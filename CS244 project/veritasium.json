Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUM\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.com\nHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'\n\nI learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.\n\nIn the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.\n\nSchrodinger's cat animation by Iv\u00e1n Tello\nWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny Hyman\nFilming of opening sequence by Casey Rentz\n\nSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the script\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP\n\nWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. \n\nTo counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.\n\nReversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProfessor David Sinclair, check out his book \"Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To\"\nAssistant Professor David Gold\nNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)\nGenepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortal\nEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tv\nAnimation: Etsuko Uno\nArt and Technical Direction: Drew Berry\nSound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma Bortignon\nScientific Consultation: Marnie Blewitt\nCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research\n\nFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek Muller\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Clearer Views\" \"Innovations\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"\nAdditional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com \"Marty Gots a Plan\"",

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"The Longest Rest\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"",

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"The Longest Rest\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\""

But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.\n\nSome of the work shown is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. EFRI-ODISSEI-1240417.

But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.\n\nSome of the work shown is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. EFRI-ODISSEI-1240417.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.\n\nBecause of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible.

                "description": "The Mars Helicopter aims to make the first powered flight on another planet when it takes off on Mars as part of the Mars 2020 mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover.\n\nHow do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:\nHave large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).\n\nPlus the aircraft has to be light:\nThe Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!\n\nOne of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:\nTemperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.\n\nThe craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible. \n\nHuge Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nPhilipp Volgger, Chris Vargas, Ron Neal, Alfred Wallace, Colin Bellmore, Michael Krugman, James Knight, Donal Botkin, Sam Lutfi, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Kevin Beavers, Chuck Lauer Vose, Bryan Baker, James Wong, kkm, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Tige Thorman, Jasper Xin, Leah Howard, Daniel Milum, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Stan Presolski, Lyvann Ferrusca, Arjun Chakroborty, June Kang, Listen Money Matters, Pindex, Joar Wandborg, DALE HORNE, Parker Linn, Roberto Rezende\n\nJonny Hyman was a legend in editing, animation, filming, and sound design for this video.",

                    "description": "The Mars Helicopter aims to make the first powered flight on another planet when it takes off on Mars as part of the Mars 2020 mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover.\n\nHow do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:\nHave large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).\n\nPlus the aircraft has to be light:\nThe Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!\n\nOne of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:\nTemperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.\n\nThe craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible. \n\nHuge Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nPhilipp Volgger, Chris Vargas, Ron Neal, Alfred Wallace, Colin Bellmore, Michael Krugman, James Knight, Donal Botkin, Sam Lutfi, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Kevin Beavers, Chuck Lauer Vose, Bryan Baker, James Wong, kkm, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Tige Thorman, Jasper Xin, Leah Howard, Daniel Milum, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Stan Presolski, Lyvann Ferrusca, Arjun Chakroborty, June Kang, Listen Money Matters, Pindex, Joar Wandborg, DALE HORNE, Parker Linn, Roberto Rezende\n\nJonny Hyman was a legend in editing, animation, filming, and sound design for this video."

Luckily, they had cod.\nCheck out Vitamania: https://ve42.co/cod\n\nWhen making a video about vitamins I thought the story would mainly be about supplement pills, whether we should or shouldn't take them and how they're made. But what I found out is vitamins have a remarkable story that affects many more aspects of our lives. For example the Vikings needed a source of vitamin D to last the dark winter months and for their children to develop strong, healthy bones, avoiding rickets.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\na human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzezi\u0144ski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick \u010calija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252\n\nThis video was filmed by Harry Panagiotidis\nResearched and written by Derek Muller and Jonny Hyman\nEditing, animation and music by Jonny Hyman\nCod liver oil animation by Iv\u00e1n Tello\nVitamania was written, directed and produced by Sonya Pemberton",

Luckily, they had cod.\nCheck out Vitamania: https://ve42.co/cod\n\nWhen making a video about vitamins I thought the story would mainly be about supplement pills, whether we should or shouldn't take them and how they're made. But what I found out is vitamins have a remarkable story that affects many more aspects of our lives. For example the Vikings needed a source of vitamin D to last the dark winter months and for their children to develop strong, healthy bones, avoiding rickets.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\na human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzezi\u0144ski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick \u010calija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252\n\nThis video was filmed by Harry Panagiotidis\nResearched and written by Derek Muller and Jonny Hyman\nEditing, animation and music by Jonny Hyman\nCod liver oil animation by Iv\u00e1n Tello\nVitamania was written, directed and produced by Sonya Pemberton"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.\n\nHuge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!\n\nThe balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.\n\nThanks to:\nLas Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dump\nEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footage\n\nResearched and Produced by Casey Rentz\n\nAnimations by Maria Raykova\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"\n\nAnd from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"\n\nThis is an educational video about the science of water quality.",

So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.\n\nThanks to:\nLas Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dump\nEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footage\n\nResearched and Produced by Casey Rentz\n\nAnimations by Maria Raykova\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"\n\nAnd from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"\n\nThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

But what is that image really showing us?\n\nThis is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:\nImage of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk\nAstronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235\nhttps://ve42.co/luminet\n\nUsing my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the \"shadow\" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.\n\nWhat about the black hole \"shadow\" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Geraint Lewis \nUniversity of Sydney https://ve42.co/gfl\nLike him, I'm hoping (predicting?) we'll see some moving images of black holes tomorrow\n\nProf. Rana Adhikari\nCaltech https://ve42.co/Rana\n\nRiccardo Antonelli - for excellent images of black holes, simulations and ray-tracing code, check out:\nhttps://ve42.co/rantonels\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration\nCheck out their resources and get your local link for the livestream here: https://ve42.co/EHT\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme\n\nFilming by Raquel Nuno\nAnimation by Maria Raykova",

This video was sponsored by B&H Photo: https://www.bhphotovideo.com\n\nHuge thanks to:\n\nRichard Diehl, Video Labguy https://www.youtube.com/user/videolabguy\nhttps://www.labguysworld.com\n\nBranch Education for awesome animations\nhttps://ve42.co/BranchEd\n\nMinutephysics for mechanical TV animations\nhttps://www.youtube.com/minutephysics\n\nMark Schubin\nEngineer and explainer, SMPTE Life Fellow\nhttps://www.smpte.org\n\nThis is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.\n\nAdditional resources and references:\n\nThe Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Medium\nhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftape\n\nWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

                    "description": "I always wanted to know why film looked better than video. Moving electronic images have as long a history but were invented for a different purpose. This video was sponsored by B&H Photo: https://www.bhphotovideo.com\n\nHuge thanks to:\n\nRichard Diehl, Video Labguy https://www.youtube.com/user/videolabguy\nhttps://www.labguysworld.com\n\nBranch Education for awesome animations\nhttps://ve42.co/BranchEd\n\nMinutephysics for mechanical TV animations\nhttps://www.youtube.com/minutephysics\n\nMark Schubin\nEngineer and explainer, SMPTE Life Fellow\nhttps://www.smpte.org\n\nThis is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.\n\nAdditional resources and references:\n\nThe Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Medium\nhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftape\n\nWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

                "description": "Is it possible to reconstruct sound from high-speed video images?\nPart of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com\n\nThis video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.\n\nSound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.\n\nSomething I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...\n\nAnimations by Alan Chamberlain\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Seaweed\"",

                    "description": "Is it possible to reconstruct sound from high-speed video images?\nPart of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com\n\nThis video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.\n\nSound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.\n\nSomething I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...\n\nAnimations by Alan Chamberlain\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Seaweed\""

Despite the fact that I know how useful it can be to be bored, I still find myself trying to fill every last moment with stimulus. Boredom is unpleasant - the open, unstructured thinking that can take place can also feel pointless. But now I'm made this video to remind myself how important boredom is so hopefully I'll make more time to be bored.\n\nMore resources:\n\nThe boredom leads people to shock themselves study:\nJust Think: The challenges of the disengaged mind\nhttps://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf\n\nBoredom leads people to consider their future and set goals study:\nBack to the future: Autobiographical planning and the functionality of mind-wandering\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810011001978\n\nOn boredom and altruism:\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ca72/0f959d3c9c31187ac30b28ecfec430bc98cc.pdf\n\nDoes boredom make us more creative?\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073\n\nAmazing filming by Raquel Nuno\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"I Think I Was There\" \"Critical Thinking 2\" \"Wide Open\" \"Seaweed\" \"A Sound Foundation 1\"\n\nMusic also by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com \"Fig Leaf Rag\""

                "description": "The nutrient content of food is declining. Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?\nWatch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita\n\nI came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.\n\nThanks to Kate Pappas & Chris Kamen for writing, producing and filming this video with me\nEdited by Lucy McCallum\nSound mix by Wayne Hyett\nFact Checking by Calvin Lee and Claire Smith \nThanks to the Collingwood Children\u2019s Farm and Glenn Fitzgerald from the University of Melbourne & Agriculture Victoria\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157516302113\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637215/?ncbi_mmode=std\nhttp://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/\nhttps://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24/scientists-warning-rice-may-become-less-nutritious/9792822",

                    "description": "The nutrient content of food is declining. Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?\nWatch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita\n\nI came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.\n\nThanks to Kate Pappas & Chris Kamen for writing, producing and filming this video with me\nEdited by Lucy McCallum\nSound mix by Wayne Hyett\nFact Checking by Calvin Lee and Claire Smith \nThanks to the Collingwood Children\u2019s Farm and Glenn Fitzgerald from the University of Melbourne & Agriculture Victoria\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157516302113\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637215/?ncbi_mmode=std\nhttp://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/\nhttps://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24/scientists-warning-rice-may-become-less-nutritious/9792822"

Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.\n2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.\n3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.\n\nSpecial thanks to HHMI BioInteractive for their awesome animations of melanocytes and how the melanin in melanosomes protect your DNA.

Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.\n2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.\n3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.\n\nSpecial thanks to HHMI BioInteractive for their awesome animations of melanocytes and how the melanin in melanosomes protect your DNA.

I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:\n\n1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.\n\n2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.\n\n3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.\n\n4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com Brandenburg Concerto No4",

I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno.",

                    "description": "Without neutrons, harnessing nuclear energy would be impossible.\nTry Audible free for 30 days: http://audible.com/veritasium\n\nI have a new documentary coming out in a few months - sign up here to be notified and see a sneak preview: http://vitamaniathemovie.com\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Yildiz Kabaran, \nTerrance Snow\n\nA few years ago I made a documentary about uranium, radioactivity and radiation. I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno."

                "description": "These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it\u2019s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let\u2019s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it\u2019s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one\u2019s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long \u2018legs\u2019 so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno",

                    "title": "Your Body's Molecular Machines",
                    "description": "These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it\u2019s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let\u2019s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it\u2019s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one\u2019s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long \u2018legs\u2019 so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).\n\nWhen I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nEdited by Bill Connor",

As an aside, the Utah constitution from 1895 required the metric system to be taught in schools. This requirement was repealed in 1987. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nHuge thanks to NIST, Ben Stein and Patrick Abbott.\nhttps://www.nist.gov/\nhttps://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/si-units-mass\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nTony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nBack in 1875 The US signed the Metre Convention, which basically committed the country to use the metric system. In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).\n\nWhen I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nEdited by Bill Connor"

They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Jeff Straathof, Donal Botkin, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Saeed Alghamdi\n\nUseful references:\nThe Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver\nThe Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes\u2019 Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nBayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Flourishing Views 3\"",

They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Jeff Straathof, Donal Botkin, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Saeed Alghamdi\n\nUseful references:\nThe Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver\nThe Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes\u2019 Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nBayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Flourishing Views 3\""

What we found is the direction of water swirl in a toilet, sink, or bathtub is determined by other sources of angular momentum.

The smoothest mirrors were created not for aesthetic joy but because when you're trying to measure wiggles that are a fraction the width of a proton, a rough mirror surface simply won't do. \n\nFilmed by Daniel Joseph Files\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod, http://www.incompetech.com \"Black Vortex\" (appropriately named)\n\nMusic licensed from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations 2\" (also appropriately named)",

The smoothest mirrors were created not for aesthetic joy but because when you're trying to measure wiggles that are a fraction the width of a proton, a rough mirror surface simply won't do. \n\nFilmed by Daniel Joseph Files\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod, http://www.incompetech.com \"Black Vortex\" (appropriately named)\n\nMusic licensed from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations 2\" (also appropriately named)"

I mean why does water freeze at 32 degrees? And what exactly does zero represent?\n\nAccording to many sources the Fahrenheit scale was defined by setting zero degrees equal to the temperature of an ice, salt, and water mixture and 100 degrees being roughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe real story is much more interesting, and scientific...\n\nAugust 14th 1701 was almost certainly the worst day in the life of fifteen year-old Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day both of his parents died suddenly from mushroom poisoning. He was sent from Poland, where he lived, to Amsterdam to become an apprentice bookkeeper.\n\nBut Fahrenheit couldn\u2019t stand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times his employers put out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with scientific instruments and in particular thermometers.\n\nIn 1708, possibly seeking help with the warrant, Fahrenheit met with the mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be the famous astronomer Ole Romer.\n\nRomer is known for observing the eclipses of Jupiter\u2019s moons and realizing that variations in the timing of those eclipses was caused by the time it took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure the finite speed of light.\n\nBut more pertinent to this story, in 1702 Romer was housebound after breaking his leg. To pass the time he devised a new temperature scale with the freezing point of water at 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees.\n\nThis might seem odd until you consider that Romer wanted the boiling point of water to be 60 degrees (as an astronomer, he had experience dividing things by 60). If you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again, and in half once more, you find the freezing point of water 1/8th up the scale, and human body temperature 3/8th up the scale.\n\nSo at their meeting in 1708, Fahrenheit learned of Romer\u2019s temperature scale and adopted it as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it \u201cinconvenient and inelegant on account of the fractional numbers\u201d. So he scaled them up to 8 and 24.\n\nThat is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers for some time using this scale.\n\nBut then, at some later time Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers on his scale by four, setting freezing point to the now familiar 32 and body temperature to 96. It\u2019s unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have wanted finer precision in his measurements but I think there was a better reason.\n\nYou see, Fahrenheit was an excellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed with each other precisely, at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury as a measuring liquid, which has the benefit of a much higher boiling point than the alcohol used in most other thermometers at the time. For these accomplishments, he was inducted into the British Royal Society.\n\nAnd we know he read the works of Newton, Boyle, and Hooke, in which he would have come across the idea that a one degree increase in temperature should correspond to a specific fractional increase in the volume of the measuring liquid.\n\nAnd today a one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature increases the volume of mercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence? We\u2019ll probably never know for sure because as an instrument maker Fahrenheit was secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly suggests this was the case.\n\nSo what exactly did zero represent on the scales of Fahrenheit and Romer? By many accounts it\u2019s the temperature of a salt, ice and water mixture. But there are different descriptions of these mixtures and none of them actually produces the temperature they\u2019re supposed to. More likely I think they picked the coldest temperature in winter, set that as zero and later used ice and brine to calibrate new thermometers. Now his scale is only used regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize, oh and the United States of America.",

We think of empty space as, well... empty, the epitome of nothingness. But as our understanding of physics has evolved we have realized that it's not truly empty. Space is filled with fields. There is a field for every subatomic particle. One for electrons, up quarks, down quarks, neutrinos and so on. In empty space these fields are basically zero, flat, nil. But it's impossible to make them perfectly zero so there are always some quantum fluctuations in the fields, even in a perfect vacuum. These are sometimes called virtual particles but they should really just be thought of as little disturbances in the field. Vacuum fluctuation play a role mediating the interactions of subatomic particles but they don't really have an impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, EXCEPT during inflation, right after the big bang when the universe increased in size 10^26 times. Due to this rapid expansion, those tiny fluctuations were blown up to the scale of the observable universe. And we know this by looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation where we can see slightly hotter and cooler parts of the early universe that correspond to density fluctuations. And it is these density fluctuations that allowed matter to clump together into large structures like the gigantic gas clouds that would go on to contain stars and planets.

Technology is not inherently superior, animations over static graphics, videoed presentations over live lectures etc. and 2. Learning is inherently a social activity, motivated and encouraged by interactions with others.\n\nFilmed and edited by Pierce Cook\n\nSupported by Screen Australia's Skip Ahead program.\n\nMusic By Kevin MacLeod, www.incompetech.com \"The Builder\" and by Amarante Music: http://www.amarantemusic.com"

To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.\n\nI was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone at BYU: Duane Merrell, Spencer Perry, Cameron Vongsawad, Jazz Myers, Ann Clawson, and Robert Willes.",

We normally think of special relativity as having little bearing on our lives because everything happens at such low speeds that relativistic effects are negligible. But when you consider the large number of charges in a wire and the strength of the electric interaction, you can see that electromagnets function thanks to the special relativistic effect of length contraction. In a frame of reference moving with the charges, there is an electric field that creates a force on the charges. But in the lab frame, there is no electric field so it must be a magnetic field creating the force.

Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously.

Thanks to audible.com for supporting this episode: http://bit.ly/ZJ5Q6z\nThe Higgs mechanism is meant to account for the mass of everything, right? Well no, only the fundamental particles, which means that electrons derive their mass entirely from the Higgs interaction but protons and neutrons, made of quarks, do not. In fact the quark masses are so small that they only make up about 1% of the mass of the proton (and a similar fraction of the neutron). The rest of the mass comes from the energy in the gluon field. Gluons are massless, but there is so much energy in the field that by E=mc^2 there is a significant amount of mass there. This is where most of your mass comes from and the mass of virtually everything around you.\n\nThanks to Professor Derek Leinweber for his great images, animations and explanations.

The reason it looks empty is because electrons and photons don't interact with the stuff that is there, quark and gluon field fluctuations.\nIt actually takes energy to clear out space and make a true 'empty' vacuum. This seems incredibly counter-intuitive but we can make an analogy to a permanent magnet. When at low energies, like at room temperature, there is a magnetic field around the magnet due to the alignment of all the magnetic moments of the atoms. But if you add some energy to it by heating it, the particles gain thermal energy, which above the Curie temperature makes their magnetic moments randomly oriented and hence destroying the magnetic field. So in this case energy is needed to clear out the field, just as in the quantum vacuum.\n\nSpecial thanks to Professor Derek Leinweber, find out more about his research here: http://bit.ly/ZZTKFP",

On me this can produce acceleration of about 1.5g's.\n\nMusic by Kevin McLeod (http://incompetech.com) Silly Fun, Also Sprach Zarathustra\nSupported by Science Alert: http://on.fb.me/14ehuxA\nSlow motion filming by Questacon: http://bit.ly/ZoWFGR"

In 1801 Thomas Young seemed to settle a long-running debate about the nature of light with his double slit experiment. He demonstrated that light passing through two slits creates patterns like water waves, with the implication that it must be a wave phenomenon.\n\nHowever, experimental results in the early 1900s found that light energy is not smoothly distributed as in a classical wave, rather it comes in discrete packets, called quanta and later photons. These are indivisible particles of light. So what would happen if individual photons passed through a double slit? Would they make a pattern like waves or like particles?",

In 1801 Thomas Young seemed to settle a long-running debate about the nature of light with his double slit experiment. He demonstrated that light passing through two slits creates patterns like water waves, with the implication that it must be a wave phenomenon.\n\nHowever, experimental results in the early 1900s found that light energy is not smoothly distributed as in a classical wave, rather it comes in discrete packets, called quanta and later photons. These are indivisible particles of light. So what would happen if individual photons passed through a double slit? Would they make a pattern like waves or like particles?"

                "description": "As a Canadian-Australian, I have always wondered why it is that Australia has so many venomous animals that can kill you while Canada has virtually none.\nSubscribe to Veritasium - it's free! http://bit.ly/YSWpWm\n\n\nBut it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?\n\nI asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:\n1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.\n2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally \"sit and wait\" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.\n3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.\n4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.\n5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.\n6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.\n\nSpecial thanks to Prof. Rick Shine, Prof. Dieter Hochuli, Prof. Roger Lowe, Prof. Martyn Poliakoff and Taronga Zoo, especially Joe Haddock and Dean Purcell.\n\nCinematography by Charles Clement",

This induces swirling currents (called eddy currents), which create a magetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet. This means work must be done to move the magnet through the pipe. This work generates the electrical energy, which is then dissipated as thermal energy in the pipe.

So many people helped with this video: Prof John Sperry, Hank Green, Henry Reich, CGP Grey, Prof Poliakoff, my mum filmed for me in beautiful Stanley Park and Jen S helped with the fourth version of the script.\n\nProf John Sperry http://biologylabs.utah.edu/sperry/john.html\nHank Green (SciShow) http://www.youtube.com/user/scishow\nHenry Reich (minutephysics) http://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics\nCGP Grey http://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey\nProf Poliakoff (Periodic Videos) http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos\n\nAlso thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte - they helped me with the whole vacuum pump setup in Paris. No, I could not actually suck water up 10m - I did about 4m, but the vacuum pump was easily able to do it and I saw spontaneous boiling on all of our various trials. Footage from this may end up on 2Veritasium.\n\nTrees create immense negative pressures of 10's of atmospheres by evaporating water from nanoscale pores, sucking water up 100m in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide. Now I didn't mention the cohesion of water (that it sticks to itself well) but this is implicit in the description of negative pressure, strong surface tension etc.",

So many people helped with this video: Prof John Sperry, Hank Green, Henry Reich, CGP Grey, Prof Poliakoff, my mum filmed for me in beautiful Stanley Park and Jen S helped with the fourth version of the script.\n\nProf John Sperry http://biologylabs.utah.edu/sperry/john.html\nHank Green (SciShow) http://www.youtube.com/user/scishow\nHenry Reich (minutephysics) http://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics\nCGP Grey http://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey\nProf Poliakoff (Periodic Videos) http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos\n\nAlso thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte - they helped me with the whole vacuum pump setup in Paris. No, I could not actually suck water up 10m - I did about 4m, but the vacuum pump was easily able to do it and I saw spontaneous boiling on all of our various trials. Footage from this may end up on 2Veritasium.\n\nTrees create immense negative pressures of 10's of atmospheres by evaporating water from nanoscale pores, sucking water up 100m in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide. Now I didn't mention the cohesion of water (that it sticks to itself well) but this is implicit in the description of negative pressure, strong surface tension etc."

This is by far the best demonstration of electromagnetic induction I have ever seen.\n\nBack in London, I visited the magnetic lab of Michael Faraday in the basement of the Royal Institution. It was here that he did his groundbreaking work on induction. People had previously observed that current in a wire causes a compass needle to deflect, but more exciting was the prospect of using a magnetic field to generate current. Faraday created his famous induction ring by winding two coils of insulated wire onto an iron ring. When he connected a battery to one coil, a small pulse of current was induced in the other. When the battery was disconnected, current was induced in the other direction. This led Faraday to the conclusion that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing.\n\nAnd if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. This is the same thing that is happening with the aluminium plate, except we're using alternating current to create a continually changing magnetic field. This induces an alternating current in the plate, producing an opposing magnetic field which levitates the disk.",

The standard idea is that the wind pushes the sails from behind, causing the boat to move forward. Although this technique is used at times, it is not the most efficient way to sail a boat (and it means the boat can never go faster than the wind). Lift is the key mechanism driving a boat forwards. As air flows over the sails, it moves faster over the outer side, creating lower pressure than on the inner side. This produces a force which is mostly to the side and a bit forwards. Lift on the centerboard pushes to the opposite side, cancelling the sideways force and adding a forward component of force to the boat.\n\nnumberphile http://bit.ly/numberphile\nefit30         http://bit.ly/O4CMme\nappchat         http://bit.ly/NxAMlX\nerikaanear         http://bit.ly/MdyUzQ\nwhoisjimmy http://bit.ly/LtFzpW\nminutephysics http://bit.ly/Muh6CC\n1veritasium http://bit.ly/MrupzL",

                    "description": "How lift actually works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFO4PBolwFg\nMore with Canadian Olympian Hunter Lowden: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YVOPUkbu6g\n\nHow does a sailboat work? The standard idea is that the wind pushes the sails from behind, causing the boat to move forward. Although this technique is used at times, it is not the most efficient way to sail a boat (and it means the boat can never go faster than the wind). Lift is the key mechanism driving a boat forwards. As air flows over the sails, it moves faster over the outer side, creating lower pressure than on the inner side. This produces a force which is mostly to the side and a bit forwards. Lift on the centerboard pushes to the opposite side, cancelling the sideways force and adding a forward component of force to the boat.\n\nnumberphile http://bit.ly/numberphile\nefit30         http://bit.ly/O4CMme\nappchat         http://bit.ly/NxAMlX\nerikaanear         http://bit.ly/MdyUzQ\nwhoisjimmy http://bit.ly/LtFzpW\nminutephysics http://bit.ly/Muh6CC\n1veritasium http://bit.ly/MrupzL"

                    "description": "This is how a slinky falls in slow motion - it appears to defy gravity but the centre of mass is accelerating at 9.8m/s^2 meaning the top is accelerating faster than that and the bottom is not falling at all until the entire slinky collapses.\n\nRead a pre-print of the physics paper here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4629\nMusic by Kevin McLeod http://incompetech.com\nSongs: Industrial Music Box, Heavy Interlude, Pale Rider, Decisions.\n\nSlow motion photography courtesy of Questacon http://questacon.edu.au\n\nThe original goal of Veritasium was to show the beauty of science and I think the first minute and a half of this is the closest I've come. This is the last in a series of six videos about slinkies."

But of course there is gravity in space, especially where the space station is located (only about 400km from Earth's surface). So astronauts still experience a gravitational pull - it's just that they and the space station are in free fall so they are accelerating together towards the Earth. The space station doesn't crash into the Earth because of its orbital velocity - it's going 28,000 km/h so as it falls, the Earth curves away from it.",

                "description": "The sun has been producing light for about five billion years but where does all its energy come from? The most common idea is that the sun is burning gas - like a giant fireball in the sky. If this were true, the sun would have gone out long ago. So how is the sun actually fuelling itself? It is converting its own mass into energy. By combining protons (the nucleus of hydrogen) into helium, it squeezes some mass into energy - 4.3 billion kg per second. It is Einstein's famous E=mc^2 which gives us the quantitative relationship between mass and energy, where c is the speed of light.",

The most common idea is that the sun is burning gas - like a giant fireball in the sky. If this were true, the sun would have gone out long ago. So how is the sun actually fuelling itself? It is converting its own mass into energy. By combining protons (the nucleus of hydrogen) into helium, it squeezes some mass into energy - 4.3 billion kg per second. It is Einstein's famous E=mc^2 which gives us the quantitative relationship between mass and energy, where c is the speed of light."

If you hold views that are consistent with the majority of the population, does that make you stupid? I don't think so. Science has uncovered a lot of counterintuitive things about the universe, so it's unsurprising that non-scientists hold beliefs inconsistent with science. But when we teach, we must take into account what the learners know, including their incorrect knowledge. That is the reason a lot of Veritasium videos start with the misconceptions.\r\n\r\nWant to read my PhD?

If you hold views that are consistent with the majority of the population, does that make you stupid? I don't think so. Science has uncovered a lot of counterintuitive things about the universe, so it's unsurprising that non-scientists hold beliefs inconsistent with science. But when we teach, we must take into account what the learners know, including their incorrect knowledge. That is the reason a lot of Veritasium videos start with the misconceptions.\r\n\r\nWant to read my PhD?

What is actually burning is wax vapour which is drawn up through the wick. When you blow a candle out, wax vapour continues to rise off the candle so you can light this vapour which burns back down to the wick, relighting the candle."

This force was originally identified while studying the trajectories of cannon balls (though earlier observations of this effect exist). The Magnus force is essential in most ball sports including golf, cricket, tennis, and baseball.\r\n\r\nAt the end the ball demonstrations were conducted with a 100 mm diam polystyrene ball and the launcher was made by bending a long, thin, aluminum rod and bolting the ends to a block of wood as a handle.\r\n\r\nMusic was provided by Kevin McLeod (incompetech.com) Scissors and a stock clip from FCP.",

This force was originally identified while studying the trajectories of cannon balls (though earlier observations of this effect exist). The Magnus force is essential in most ball sports including golf, cricket, tennis, and baseball.\r\n\r\nAt the end the ball demonstrations were conducted with a 100 mm diam polystyrene ball and the launcher was made by bending a long, thin, aluminum rod and bolting the ends to a block of wood as a handle.\r\n\r\nMusic was provided by Kevin McLeod (incompetech.com) Scissors and a stock clip from FCP."

When that pressure is removed it goes back to being solid. This process is known as 'regelation'. In this experiment regelation of ice is attempted with copper wire and fishing line of the same diameter. Which will pass through the ice first?"

                "description": "In Sydney, ice melts because it is warm out in the middle of the day (even in winter). This creates a layer of water on top that certainly makes it slippery. But should it be slippery at night or in a cold northern climate where the air temperature is below zero? Yes, because the pressure your skates apply to the ice actually lowers its melting point allowing you to glide along a thin layer of water.\r\n\r\nAnimation in this video is courtesy of VisChem (TM), Copyright 1995, Roy Tasker\r\n\r\nFor a more complete picture of the mechanisms involved in making ice slippery, check out this great article: http://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf",

                    "description": "In Sydney, ice melts because it is warm out in the middle of the day (even in winter). This creates a layer of water on top that certainly makes it slippery. But should it be slippery at night or in a cold northern climate where the air temperature is below zero? Yes, because the pressure your skates apply to the ice actually lowers its melting point allowing you to glide along a thin layer of water.\r\n\r\nAnimation in this video is courtesy of VisChem (TM), Copyright 1995, Roy Tasker\r\n\r\nFor a more complete picture of the mechanisms involved in making ice slippery, check out this great article: http://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf"

One of the most common misconceptions in physics is the belief that constant motion requires a constant force. So many people believe there must be some force in the Earth (e.g. gravity, centrifugal force) that keeps it spinning. In truth, no force is required because a fundamental property of mass is that it maintains its state of motion in the absence of external forces. This property is called inertia.",

The eye is capable of panning smoothly however. If something moves in your field of view, your eyes track it smoothly. This has an important effect on our perception of motion. It makes it more difficult to see when objects are accelerating since the eye tracks all motion quite smoothly.",

The eye is capable of panning smoothly however. If something moves in your field of view, your eyes track it smoothly. This has an important effect on our perception of motion. It makes it more difficult to see when objects are accelerating since the eye tracks all motion quite smoothly."

It gives us life and sustains us in the manner we're accustomed to, but we don't know the first thing about it: like where did it come from? And how did it form? Most people recognize that the Earth has a big explosion in its history, which they refer to descriptively as the 'Big Bang.' But there are two very good reasons why the Big Bang is not directly responsible for forming the Earth: 1) It happened 13.7 billion years ago. That's more than 9 billion years before the Earth formed (what happened during that time?), and 2) After the Big Bang the universe consisted of only Hydrogen and Helium - not great raw material for building the Earth. The truth is the big bang formed stars, which exploded and then (perhaps) formed more stars, which exploded and then formed our solar system, including the Earth. The early stars performed the vital role of making the heavier elements of which Earth is composed and we are made.",

                    "description": "Do we take the Earth for granted? It gives us life and sustains us in the manner we're accustomed to, but we don't know the first thing about it: like where did it come from? And how did it form? Most people recognize that the Earth has a big explosion in its history, which they refer to descriptively as the 'Big Bang.' But there are two very good reasons why the Big Bang is not directly responsible for forming the Earth: 1) It happened 13.7 billion years ago. That's more than 9 billion years before the Earth formed (what happened during that time?), and 2) After the Big Bang the universe consisted of only Hydrogen and Helium - not great raw material for building the Earth. The truth is the big bang formed stars, which exploded and then (perhaps) formed more stars, which exploded and then formed our solar system, including the Earth. The early stars performed the vital role of making the heavier elements of which Earth is composed and we are made."

Why is that? Is it because the gravitational force on them is zero in space? (Or nearly zero?) The truth is that the strength of the gravitational attraction is only slightly less than it is on Earth's surface. So how are they able to float? Well, they aren't floating - they're falling, along with the space station. They don't crash into the Earth because they have a huge orbital velocity. So as they accelerate towards the Earth, the Earth curves away beneath them and they never get any closer. Since the astronauts have the same acceleration as the space station, they feel weightless.

It seems obvious that the heavy one should accelerate at a greater rate and therefore land first because the force pulling it down is greater. But this is forgetting inertia - the tendency of mass to resist changes in motion. Therefore, although the force on the medicine ball is greater, it takes this larger force to accelerate the ball at the same rate as the basketball.",

It seems obvious that the heavy one should accelerate at a greater rate and therefore land first because the force pulling it down is greater. But this is forgetting inertia - the tendency of mass to resist changes in motion. Therefore, although the force on the medicine ball is greater, it takes this larger force to accelerate the ball at the same rate as the basketball."

Most people would say no, the Earth exerts a greater force of attraction because it is larger and has more mass. This is a situation in which Newton's Third Law is relevant. Newton's Third Law says that for every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. So the force the Earth exerts on the moon must be exactly equal and opposite the force the moon exerts on the Earth. But how can that be - that the same size force keeps the moon orbiting, but barely affects the Earth? The answer is inertia - the tendency for all objects with mass to maintain their state of motion.

They saw a glow from the tube that seemed to emanate from the negatively charged plate called the cathode. Since scientists didn't know what the glow was they called it a cathode ray. There was debate over whether the cathode ray was a wave phenomenon like light or a stream of negatively charged particles. JJ Thomson effectively resolved the debate in 1897 by performing a clever experiment that determined the charge to mass ratio of the particles making up the cathode ray. He also showed that this same particle was in all different cathode materials so it must be a constituent common to all atoms.
