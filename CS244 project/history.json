The eight-episode, one-hour series premieres Tuesday, November 12 at 10PM ET/PT on HISTORY.\n\nIn 1983 entomologist Dr. Justin O. Schmidt began ranking stinging insects on a scale from 1-4, putting himself in harm\u2019s way for science creating the Schmidt sting pain index and authoring the book The Sting of The Wild. Now Thorn and Alleva are taking Schmidt\u2019s pain index even further adding venomous bites and more deadly creatures and ranking them on a 30-point scale with new categories including intensity, duration and damage. Their goal is to create history\u2019s ultimate and fully comprehensive guide to measuring pain. In addition, they will be consulting with Schmidt as they build this new pain index that is completely new to science to be used as an educational tool showcasing which creatures humans should avoid and what to do in the event they do get bitten or stung.\n\nEach episode will chronicle Thorn and Alleva as they track the animal in its natural habitat, safely trap it and then execute the bite or sting on each other, followed by their ranking of the pain results. An onsite medic is present who monitors the health and well-being of both men and describes to viewers exactly what physical and physiological effects each bite and/or sting is creating within their bodies. Along their journey, viewers will also be learning about the history of each animal featured and its often-uncomfortable relationship with humans. Deadly wildlife featured over this eight-episode season include the Nile monitor lizard, executioner wasp, fire urchin, rove beetle, lionfish, scorpion fish, bullet ant, piranha, tarantula hawk, giant Asian centipede and the reticulated python \u2013 to name a few. Audiences will also get the chance to travel the world from the remote jungles of Bolivia, the Amazon and Indonesia to the beaches of Bali, South Africa, Mexico and Baja California.\nSubscribe for more HISTORY:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=historychannel\n\nCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:\nHistory Newsletter: http://po.st/HistoryNewsletter\nWebsite - http://po.st/HistoryWeb\nFacebook - http://po.st/HistoryFacebook\nTwitter - http://po.st/HistoryTwitter\n\nHISTORY\u00ae is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

But has Bjorn arrived too late?\n\nHISTORY\u2019s hit drama series \u201cVikings\u201d returned on Wednesday, November 28 at 9 PM ET/PT.\n\nIn the mid-season five finale, the divide between the Lothbrok family climaxes with Ragnar\u2019s sons battling each other to rule the world. The long-awaited faceoff ends with a strategic victory going to Ivar the Boneless (Alex H\u00f8gh Andersen) who vows vengeance on his betrayers with a direct target on Lagertha\u2019s (Katheryn Winnick) back. Last seen in an unstable state and losing her appearance as a fierce Viking warrior, Lagertha is hopeful she will regain her spot in Kattegat as its rightful leader.\n\nSeason five returns on November 28 with the arrival of a legendary Viking, the famous Duke Rollo (Clive Standen), who causes further upheaval in a Kattegat still reeling from Ivar the Boneless becoming its King. As Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig) and Lagertha flee Ivar\u2019s murderous forces with Bishop Heahmund (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Ivar\u2019s tyrannical reign over Scandinavia ushers in a new Dark Age, the likes of which have never been seen. Ultimately, Ivar\u2019s reign will not go unchallenged by the sons of Ragnar and old enemies will become allies to defeat the despot who has declared himself a God on earth. Meanwhile in Iceland, Floki (Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd) battles the elements, and his own settlers\u2019 desire for revenge, to forge a Viking colony on the beautiful and desolate landscape. #Vikings\nSubscribe for more HISTORY:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=historychannel\n\nCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:\nNewsletter: https://www.history.com/newsletter\nWebsite - http://www.history.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/History\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/history\n\nHISTORY\u00ae, now reaching more than 98 million homes, is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

An exclusive trailer from the mid-season five premiere was unveiled to nearly 5,000 fans during the \u201cVikings\u201d cast panel held in Ballroom 20 on Friday, July 20 at Comic-Con. \n\nIn the mid-season five finale, the divide between the Lothbrok family climaxes with Ragnar\u2019s sons battling each other to rule the world. The long-awaited faceoff ends with a strategic victory going to Ivar the Boneless (Alex H\u00f8gh Andersen) who vows vengeance on his betrayers with a direct target on Lagertha\u2019s (Katheryn Winnick) back. Last seen in an unstable state and losing her appearance as a fierce Viking warrior, Lagertha is hopeful she will regain her spot in Kattegat as its rightful leader.\n\nSeason five returns on November 28 with the arrival of a legendary Viking, the famous Duke Rollo (Clive Standen), who causes further upheaval in a Kattegat still reeling from Ivar the Boneless becoming its King. As Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig) and Lagertha flee Ivar\u2019s murderous forces with Bishop Heahmund (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), Ivar\u2019s tyrannical reign over Scandinavia ushers in a new Dark Age, the likes of which have never been seen. Ultimately, Ivar\u2019s reign will not go unchallenged by the sons of Ragnar and old enemies will become allies to defeat the despot who has declared himself a God on earth. Meanwhile in Iceland, Floki (Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd) battles the elements, and his own settlers\u2019 desire for revenge, to forge a Viking colony on the beautiful and desolate landscape. #Vikings\nSubscribe for more HISTORY:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=historychannel\n\nCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:\nNewsletter: https://www.history.com/newsletter\nWebsite - http://www.history.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/History\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/history\n\nHISTORY\u00ae, now reaching more than 98 million homes, is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

Check out the trailer for HISTORY's new drama series Knightfall premiering December 6 at 10/9c. #Knightfall\n \nFrom A+E Studios in association with Jeremy Renner\u2019s The Combine, Island Pictures and Midnight Radio, the ten episode season takes viewers inside the medieval politics and warfare of the Knights Templar, the most powerful, wealthy and mysterious military order of the Middle Ages who were entrusted with protecting Christianity\u2019s most precious relics.\n \n\u201cKnightfall\u201d begins after the fall of the city of Acre, the Templar\u2019s last stronghold in the Holy Land, where the Holy Grail is lost. Years later, a clue emerges suggesting the whereabouts of the Grail and sends the Templars, led by the noble, courageous and headstrong Templar Knight Landry (Tom Cullen, \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d \u201cGunpowder\u201d), on a life or death mission to find the lost Cup of Christ. From their battles in the Holy Land, to their clash with the King of France, to the dark events leading to the demise of the Templar Order on Friday the 13th, 1307 \u2014a date which became synonymous with bad luck\u2014the story of the Knights Templar has never been fully told until now. Focusing on themes such as belief, sacrifice, politics, love, power and revenge \u2013  \u201cKnightfall\u201d goes deep into the clandestine world of this legendary brotherhood of warrior monks to find out who these knights were, how they lived, and what they died believing.\n\nSubscribe for more HISTORY:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=historychannel\n\nNewsletter: https://www.history.com/newsletter\nWebsite - http://www.history.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/History\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/history\n\nHISTORY\u00ae, now reaching more than 98 million homes, is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

Check out the trailer for HISTORY's new drama series Knightfall premiering December 6 at 10/9c. #Knightfall\n \nFrom A+E Studios in association with Jeremy Renner\u2019s The Combine, Island Pictures and Midnight Radio, the ten episode season takes viewers inside the medieval politics and warfare of the Knights Templar, the most powerful, wealthy and mysterious military order of the Middle Ages who were entrusted with protecting Christianity\u2019s most precious relics.\n \n\u201cKnightfall\u201d begins after the fall of the city of Acre, the Templar\u2019s last stronghold in the Holy Land, where the Holy Grail is lost. Years later, a clue emerges suggesting the whereabouts of the Grail and sends the Templars, led by the noble, courageous and headstrong Templar Knight Landry (Tom Cullen, \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d \u201cGunpowder\u201d), on a life or death mission to find the lost Cup of Christ. From their battles in the Holy Land, to their clash with the King of France, to the dark events leading to the demise of the Templar Order on Friday the 13th, 1307 \u2014a date which became synonymous with bad luck\u2014the story of the Knights Templar has never been fully told until now. Focusing on themes such as belief, sacrifice, politics, love, power and revenge \u2013  \u201cKnightfall\u201d goes deep into the clandestine world of this legendary brotherhood of warrior monks to find out who these knights were, how they lived, and what they died believing.\n\nSubscribe for more HISTORY:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=historychannel\n\nNewsletter: https://www.history.com/newsletter\nWebsite - http://www.history.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/History\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/history\n\nHISTORY\u00ae, now reaching more than 98 million homes, is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.
