A previous launch attempt on Feb. 9 was scrubbed after off-nominal readings from a ground support sensor. The Cygnus cargo spacecraft, loaded with approximately 7,500 pounds of research, supplies and hardware, lifted off atop an Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. This Cygnus spacecraft is named the S.S. Robert H. Lawrence in honor of the first African American to be selected as an astronaut.",

A previous launch attempt on Feb. 9 was scrubbed after off-nominal readings from a ground support sensor. The Cygnus cargo spacecraft, loaded with approximately 7,500 pounds of research, supplies and hardware, lifted off atop an Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. This Cygnus spacecraft is named the S.S. Robert H. Lawrence in honor of the first African American to be selected as an astronaut."

Koch, along with station Commander Luca Parmitano of ESA (European Space Agency), and Soyuz commander Alexander Skvortsov of the Russian space agency Roscosmos departed the station in a Soyuz spacecraft that made a parachute-assisted landing at 4:12 a.m. EST southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.\n\nKoch's extended mission will provide researchers the opportunity to observe effects of long-duration spaceflight on a woman, as we prepare for Artemis missions to the Moon and human exploration of Mars.",

Koch, along with station Commander Luca Parmitano of ESA (European Space Agency), and Soyuz commander Alexander Skvortsov of the Russian space agency Roscosmos departed the station in a Soyuz spacecraft that made a parachute-assisted landing at 4:12 a.m. EST southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.\n\nKoch's extended mission will provide researchers the opportunity to observe effects of long-duration spaceflight on a woman, as we prepare for Artemis missions to the Moon and human exploration of Mars."

This was the final major flight test of the spacecraft before it begins carrying astronauts to the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. Crew Dragon lifted off from Launch Complex 39A aboard a Falcon 9 rocket at 10:30 a.m. EST, then separated from the rocket after an intentionally triggered launch escape. Dragon\u2019s drogue and main parachutes sequenced to provide for a soft landing in the Atlantic Ocean."

                    "description": "Astronauts Andrew Morgan of NASA and Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency (ESA) will venture outside the International Space Station starting at ~7:05 a.m. EST to continue repairing the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument. This is the second in a series of repair spacewalks - the most complex of this kind since the servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope. AMS is attached to the outside of the space station, where it has been operating since 2011. It is a particle physics experiment working to help us understand dark matter and the origins of the universe."

A turn toward the north is forecast by Wednesday evening, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast Thursday morning.

Now a high category 2 hurricane, the storm is beginning to move northwestward at about 2 miles per hour with a slightly faster motion toward the northwest or north-northwest expected later today and tonight. A turn toward the north is forecast by Wednesday evening, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast Thursday morning. On this track, the core of extremely dangerous Hurricane Dorian will gradually move north of Grand Bahama Island this evening. The hurricane will then move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late today through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday and Thursday night.\n\nData from reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 110 miles per hour with higher gusts. Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days.\n\nDownload this video: https://images.nasa.gov/details-iss060m262461429_Expedition_60_ISS_Hurricane_Dorian_Live_Views_2019_0903.html\n\nFor the latest updates on Hurricane Dorian from NASA, visit: https://blogs.nasa.gov/hurricanes/tag/dorian-2019/"

In its 11:00 a.m. EDT advisory, the National Hurricane Center said Dorian was almost stationary, moving toward the west at just 1 mile an hour just over 100 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida, packing catastrophic sustained winds of 155 miles an hour.

Making multiple flights, the Dragonfly dual-quadcopter will explore a variety of locations on Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is an analog to the very early Earth, and can provide clues to how life may have arisen on our planet.\n\nIn under an hour, Dragonfly will cover tens of miles or kilometers, farther than any planetary rover has traveled. With one hop per full Titan day (16 Earth days), the rotorcraft will travel from its initial landing site to cover areas several hundred kilometers away during the planned two-year mission. Despite its unique ability to fly, Dragonfly would spend most of its time on Titan's surface making science measurements.\n\nFor more information, check out: http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/",

                "description": "Fifty years ago, Apollo 10 launched from Cape Kennedy on May 18, 1969. The Apollo 10 mission encompassed all aspects of an actual crewed lunar landing, except the landing. It was the first flight of a complete, crewed Apollo spacecraft to operate around the Moon. The crew members were Commander Thomas Stafford, Command Module Pilot John Young and Lunar Module Pilot Eugene Cernan. Objectives included a scheduled eight-hour lunar orbit of the separated lunar module, or LM, and descent to about nine miles off the moon's surface before ascending for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module, or CSM, in about a 70-mile circular lunar orbit. Pertinent data to be gathered in this landing rehearsal dealt with the lunar potential, or gravitational effect, to refine the Earth-based crewed spaceflight network tracking techniques, and to check out LM programmed trajectories and radar, and lunar flight control systems. Twelve television transmissions to Earth were planned. All mission objectives were achieved.",

The Apollo 10 mission encompassed all aspects of an actual crewed lunar landing, except the landing. It was the first flight of a complete, crewed Apollo spacecraft to operate around the Moon. The crew members were Commander Thomas Stafford, Command Module Pilot John Young and Lunar Module Pilot Eugene Cernan. Objectives included a scheduled eight-hour lunar orbit of the separated lunar module, or LM, and descent to about nine miles off the moon's surface before ascending for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module, or CSM, in about a 70-mile circular lunar orbit. Pertinent data to be gathered in this landing rehearsal dealt with the lunar potential, or gravitational effect, to refine the Earth-based crewed spaceflight network tracking techniques, and to check out LM programmed trajectories and radar, and lunar flight control systems. Twelve television transmissions to Earth were planned. All mission objectives were achieved."

Crew Dragon is designed to transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with critical cargo and supplies, to the International Space Station as part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. \n\nThe Crew Dragon features solar arrays affixed to the side of the spacecraft\u2019s trunk, a launch escape system that will allow crew members to escape an anomaly at any point during flight, a large hatch and windows and a redesigned outer mold line to enhance crew comfort. The first uncrewed flight is an important step in returning human launches on American rockets and spacecraft to the space station from U.S. soil since 2011.",

Crew Dragon is designed to transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with critical cargo and supplies, to the International Space Station as part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. \n\nThe Crew Dragon features solar arrays affixed to the side of the spacecraft\u2019s trunk, a launch escape system that will allow crew members to escape an anomaly at any point during flight, a large hatch and windows and a redesigned outer mold line to enhance crew comfort. The first uncrewed flight is an important step in returning human launches on American rockets and spacecraft to the space station from U.S. soil since 2011."

Season 1, \u201cCryosphere,\u201d joins NASA scientists on their journey to the frozen ends of the Earth as they study our rapidly changing world from satellites, planes and boots on the ground. The Cryosphere is a place we all depend on, but many of us will never go to. As temperatures rise, the frozen regions of Earth are changing rapidly. NASA scientists are locked in a race against time to understand our shifting climate and how it affects life on Earth."

Read the story: https://go.nasa.gov/2KEExYZ NASA launch schedule: https://go.nasa.gov/2JfklMB  \n\nThe Sun contains 99.8 of the mass in our solar system. Its gravitational pull is what keeps everything here, from tiny Mercury to the gas giants to the Oort Cloud, 186 billion miles away.\n\nBut even though the Sun has such a powerful pull, it's surprisingly hard to actually go to the Sun: It takes 55 times more energy to go to the Sun than it does to go to Mars. Why is it so difficult? The answer lies in the same fact that keeps Earth from plunging into the Sun: Our planet is traveling very fast - about 67,000 miles per hour - almost entirely sideways relative to the Sun. The only way to get to the Sun is to cancel that sideways motion. \n\nSince Parker Solar Probe will skim through the Sun's atmosphere, it only needs to drop 53,000 miles per hour of sideways motion to reach its destination, but that's no easy feat. In addition to using a powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, Parker Solar Probe will perform seven Venus gravity assists over its seven-year mission to shed sideways speed into Venus' well of orbital energy. These gravity assists will draw Parker Solar Probe's orbit closer to the Sun for a record approach of just 3.83 million miles from the Sun's visible surface on the final orbits. \n\nThough it's shedding sideways speed to get closer to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe will pick up overall speed, bolstered by Sun's extreme gravity - so it will also break the record for the fastest-ever human-made objects, clocking in at 430,000 miles per hour on its final orbits. \n\nMusic: Percs and Pizz from Killer Tracks. \nCredit: NASA's Godddard Space flight Center",

                "channelId": "UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ",
                "description": "A new study using data from NASA's NuSTAR space telescope suggests that the most luminous and massive stellar system within 10,000 light-years, Eta Carinae, is accelerating particles to high energies -- some of which may reach Earth as cosmic rays. https://go.nasa.gov/2tPxKpA\n\nCosmic rays with energies greater than 1 billion electron volts (eV) come to us from beyond our solar system. But because these particles -- electrons, protons and atomic nuclei -- all carry an electrical charge, they veer off course whenever they encounter magnetic fields. This scrambles their paths and masks their origins. Eta Carinae, located about 7,500 light-years away in the southern constellation of Carina, contains a pair of massive stars whose eccentric orbits bring them unusually close every 5.5 years. The stars contain 90 and 30 times the mass of our Sun. \n\nBoth stars drive powerful outflows called stellar winds, which emit low-energy X-rays where they collide. NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observes gamma rays -- light packing far more energy than X-rays -- from a source in the direction of Eta Carinae. \n\nBut Fermi's vision isn't as sharp as X-ray telescopes, so astronomers couldn't confirm the connection. To bridge this gap, astronomers turned to NASA's NuSTAR observatory. Launched in 2012, NuSTAR can focus X-rays of much greater energy than any previous telescope. \n\nThe team examined NuSTAR observations acquired between March 2014 and June 2016, along with lower-energy X-ray observations from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite over the same period. NuSTAR detects a source emitting X-rays above 30,000 eV, some three times higher than can be explained by shock waves in the colliding winds.

                    "description": "A new study using data from NASA's NuSTAR space telescope suggests that the most luminous and massive stellar system within 10,000 light-years, Eta Carinae, is accelerating particles to high energies -- some of which may reach Earth as cosmic rays. https://go.nasa.gov/2tPxKpA\n\nCosmic rays with energies greater than 1 billion electron volts (eV) come to us from beyond our solar system. But because these particles -- electrons, protons and atomic nuclei -- all carry an electrical charge, they veer off course whenever they encounter magnetic fields. This scrambles their paths and masks their origins. Eta Carinae, located about 7,500 light-years away in the southern constellation of Carina, contains a pair of massive stars whose eccentric orbits bring them unusually close every 5.5 years. The stars contain 90 and 30 times the mass of our Sun. \n\nBoth stars drive powerful outflows called stellar winds, which emit low-energy X-rays where they collide. NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observes gamma rays -- light packing far more energy than X-rays -- from a source in the direction of Eta Carinae. \n\nBut Fermi's vision isn't as sharp as X-ray telescopes, so astronomers couldn't confirm the connection. To bridge this gap, astronomers turned to NASA's NuSTAR observatory. Launched in 2012, NuSTAR can focus X-rays of much greater energy than any previous telescope. \n\nThe team examined NuSTAR observations acquired between March 2014 and June 2016, along with lower-energy X-ray observations from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite over the same period. NuSTAR detects a source emitting X-rays above 30,000 eV, some three times higher than can be explained by shock waves in the colliding winds. For comparison, the energy of visible light ranges from about 2 to 3 eV. \n\nThe researchers say both the X-ray emission s een by NuSTAR and the gamma-ray emission seen by Fermi is best explained by electrons accelerated in shock waves where the winds collide. The X-rays detected by NuSTAR and the gamma rays detected by Fermi arise from starlight given a huge energy boost by interactions with these electrons. Some of the superfast electrons, as well as other accelerated particles, must escape the system and perhaps some eventually wander to Earth, where they may be detected as cosmic rays.

Infrared cameras are used to sense the temperature of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and provide insight into how the powerful cyclones at Jupiter's poles work. In the animation, the yellow areas are warmer (or deeper into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere) and the dark areas are colder (or higher up in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere).  In this picture the highest \u201cbrightness temperature\u201d is around 260K (about -13\u00b0C) and the lowest around 190K (about -83\u00b0C). The \u201cbrightness temperature\u201d is a measurement of the radiance, at 5 \u00b5m, traveling upward from the top of the atmosphere towards Juno, expressed in units of temperature.\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM",

Infrared cameras are used to sense the temperature of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and provide insight into how the powerful cyclones at Jupiter's poles work. In the animation, the yellow areas are warmer (or deeper into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere) and the dark areas are colder (or higher up in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere).  In this picture the highest \u201cbrightness temperature\u201d is around 260K (about -13\u00b0C) and the lowest around 190K (about -83\u00b0C). The \u201cbrightness temperature\u201d is a measurement of the radiance, at 5 \u00b5m, traveling upward from the top of the atmosphere towards Juno, expressed in units of temperature.\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM"

Additionally, a partial eclipse will be viewable across all of North America. The eclipse will provide a unique opportunity to study the sun, Earth, moon and their interaction because of the eclipse\u2019s long path over land coast to coast. Scientists will be able to take ground-based and airborne observations over a period of an hour and a half to complement the wealth of data and images provided by space assets.",

Additionally, a partial eclipse will be viewable across all of North America. The eclipse will provide a unique opportunity to study the sun, Earth, moon and their interaction because of the eclipse\u2019s long path over land coast to coast. Scientists will be able to take ground-based and airborne observations over a period of an hour and a half to complement the wealth of data and images provided by space assets."

Three of these planets are in the habitable zone, the region around the star in which liquid water is most likely to thrive on a rocky planet. This is the first time so many planets have been found in a single star's habitable zone, and the first time so many Earth-sized planets have been found around the same star. The finding of this planetary system, called TRAPPIST-1, is the best target yet for studying the atmospheres of potentially habitable, Earth-sized worlds",

                    "description": "NASA held a news conference Feb. 22 at the agency\u2019s headquarters to discuss the finding by the Spitzer Space Telescope of seven Earth-sized planets around a tiny, nearby, ultra-cool dwarf star. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone, the region around the star in which liquid water is most likely to thrive on a rocky planet. This is the first time so many planets have been found in a single star's habitable zone, and the first time so many Earth-sized planets have been found around the same star. The finding of this planetary system, called TRAPPIST-1, is the best target yet for studying the atmospheres of potentially habitable, Earth-sized worlds"

OSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. mission to sample an asteroid, is scheduled to arrive at near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018. Mission plans call for the spacecraft to survey the asteroid, retrieve a small sample from its surface, and return the sample to Earth for study in 2023. Analysis of that sample is expected to reveal clues about the history of Bennu over the past 4.5 billion years, as well as clues about the evolution of our solar system.

                    "description": "On Sept. 8, NASA launched the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security - Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. OSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. mission to sample an asteroid, is scheduled to arrive at near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018. Mission plans call for the spacecraft to survey the asteroid, retrieve a small sample from its surface, and return the sample to Earth for study in 2023. Analysis of that sample is expected to reveal clues about the history of Bennu over the past 4.5 billion years, as well as clues about the evolution of our solar system.

                "description": "Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell (USN Capt. Ret.), who became the sixth man to walk on the moon during the Apollo 14 mission to the highlands of Fra Mauro, died on Feb. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 85. Mitchell\u2019s death occurred on the eve of the 45th anniversary of his landing on the moon aboard the lunar module Antares with Apollo 14 Commander Alan Shepard. Mitchell was born in Hereford, Texas on Sept. 17, 1930, and earned multiple degrees including a Doctorate of Science in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964. Mitchell entered the Navy in 1952 and was selected by NASA as an astronaut in April 1966. He was the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 14 mission, his only spaceflight, joining Shepard and command module pilot Stuart Roosa. On Feb. 5, 1971, Mitchell and Shepard guided Antares to a bulls-eye landing at Fra Mauro, where they spent 33 hours and conducted two moonwalks to collect almost 100 pounds of moon rocks and invaluable lunar soil samples. Following the Apollo program, Mitchell retired from NASA and from the Navy to conduct scientific research in the field of human consciousness.",

                    "description": "Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell (USN Capt. Ret.), who became the sixth man to walk on the moon during the Apollo 14 mission to the highlands of Fra Mauro, died on Feb. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 85. Mitchell\u2019s death occurred on the eve of the 45th anniversary of his landing on the moon aboard the lunar module Antares with Apollo 14 Commander Alan Shepard. Mitchell was born in Hereford, Texas on Sept. 17, 1930, and earned multiple degrees including a Doctorate of Science in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964. Mitchell entered the Navy in 1952 and was selected by NASA as an astronaut in April 1966. He was the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 14 mission, his only spaceflight, joining Shepard and command module pilot Stuart Roosa. On Feb. 5, 1971, Mitchell and Shepard guided Antares to a bulls-eye landing at Fra Mauro, where they spent 33 hours and conducted two moonwalks to collect almost 100 pounds of moon rocks and invaluable lunar soil samples. Following the Apollo program, Mitchell retired from NASA and from the Navy to conduct scientific research in the field of human consciousness."

These included an image from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager or (LORRI) \u2013 looking back at Pluto \u2013 hours after the historic flyby that revealed a haze in the planet\u2019s sunlit atmosphere that extends as high as 80 miles above Pluto\u2019s surface \u2013 much higher than expected. Models suggest that the hazes form when ultraviolet sunlight breaks apart methane gas. LORRI images also show evidence that exotic ices have flowed \u2013 and may still be flowing across Pluto\u2019s surface, similar to glacial movement on Earth. This unpredicted sign of present-day geologic activity was detected in Sputnik Planum \u2013 an area in the western part of Pluto\u2019s heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio. Additionally, new compositional data from New Horizons\u2019 Ralph instrument indicate that the center of Sputnik Planum is rich in nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices.

The Hubble story is a human story. Hubble overcame much adversity early on in its mission and demonstrated the great heights NASA is capable of achieving against all odds.  Much of that is thanks to the \u201cHubble Heroes\u201d, including scientists, engineers, and the brave astronauts who flew five Space Shuttle missions to service Hubble.\n\nJoin NASA Television in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit April 24, 2015."

Orion is in the final stages of preparation for the uncrewed flight test that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth on a 4.5-hour mission to test many of the systems necessary for future human missions into deep space. After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour, and reach temperatures near 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n \nOn future missions, the Orion spacecraft will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before, including to an asteroid and Mars.",

Orion is in the final stages of preparation for the uncrewed flight test that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth on a 4.5-hour mission to test many of the systems necessary for future human missions into deep space. After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour, and reach temperatures near 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n \nOn future missions, the Orion spacecraft will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before, including to an asteroid and Mars."

The EVA lasted approximately 2.5 hours with all scientific activities being completed satisfactorily.  The Apollo 11 (EVA) began at 10:39:33 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969 when Astronaut Neil Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft first. While descending, he released the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly on the Lunar Module's descent stage. A camera on this module provided live television coverage of man's first step on the Moon. On this, their one and only EVA, the astronauts had a great deal to do in a short time. During this first visit to the Moon, the astronauts remained within about 100 meters of the lunar module, collected about 47 pounds of samples, and deployed four experiments. After spending approximately 2 hours and 31 minutes on the surface, the astronauts ended the EVA at 1:11:13 a.m. EDT on July 21.",

The EVA lasted approximately 2.5 hours with all scientific activities being completed satisfactorily.  The Apollo 11 (EVA) began at 10:39:33 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969 when Astronaut Neil Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft first. While descending, he released the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly on the Lunar Module's descent stage. A camera on this module provided live television coverage of man's first step on the Moon. On this, their one and only EVA, the astronauts had a great deal to do in a short time. During this first visit to the Moon, the astronauts remained within about 100 meters of the lunar module, collected about 47 pounds of samples, and deployed four experiments. After spending approximately 2 hours and 31 minutes on the surface, the astronauts ended the EVA at 1:11:13 a.m. EDT on July 21."

It may be a small, ice-covered moon of Jupiter or Saturn that harbors some of the most habitable real estate in our Solar System.  Life loves liquid water and these moons have lots of it!  Dr.Kevin Hand, Deputy Chief Scientist for Solar System Exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory explains the science behind how these oceans exist and what we know about the conditions on these worlds. Dr. Hand focuses on Jupiter's moon Europa, which is a top priority for future NASA missions and shows how the exploration of Earth's ocean is helping our understanding of the potential habitability of worlds."

The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft delivered Curiosity to its target area on Mars at 1:31:45 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012 which includes the 13.8 minutes needed for confirmation of the touchdown to be radioed to Earth at the speed of light. The rover will conduct a nearly two-year prime mission to investigate whether the Gale Crater region of Mars ever offered conditions favorable for microbial life.\n \nCuriosity carries 10 science instruments with a total mass 15 times as large as the science payloads on NASA's Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Some of the tools, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking rocks' elemental composition from a distance, are the first of their kind on Mars. Curiosity will use a drill and scoop, which are located at the end of its robotic arm, to gather soil and powdered samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into the rover's analytical laboratory instruments.",

Google+ Hangouts allow people to chat face-to-face while thousands more can tune in to watch the conversation live on Google+ or YouTube. This unique opportunity connected you, our fans, with astronauts living and working on the orbiting laboratory 240 miles above the Earth.\n\nDuring the event, several video questions were selected and answered by astronauts on the space station and on the ground. Additionally, NASA asked real-time questions submitted by our followers on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook. During the hangout, astronauts Kevin Ford, Chris Hadfield and Tom Marshburn will answer questions and provide insights about life aboard the station. Station crews conduct a variety of science experiments and perform station maintenance during their six-month stay on the outpost. Their life aboard the station in near-weightlessness requires unique approaches to everyday activities such as eating, sleeping and exercising.",

                    "description": "In a first for the agency, NASA hosted a Google+ Hangout live with the International Space Station on Feb. 22, 2013 from 10:30 a.m EST to 11:30 a.m. EST. Google+ Hangouts allow people to chat face-to-face while thousands more can tune in to watch the conversation live on Google+ or YouTube. This unique opportunity connected you, our fans, with astronauts living and working on the orbiting laboratory 240 miles above the Earth.\n\nDuring the event, several video questions were selected and answered by astronauts on the space station and on the ground. Additionally, NASA asked real-time questions submitted by our followers on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook. During the hangout, astronauts Kevin Ford, Chris Hadfield and Tom Marshburn will answer questions and provide insights about life aboard the station. Station crews conduct a variety of science experiments and perform station maintenance during their six-month stay on the outpost. Their life aboard the station in near-weightlessness requires unique approaches to everyday activities such as eating, sleeping and exercising."
