Today we're talking about the economic cultural recovery of the 1920s, and the economic depression of the 1930s, and the fragile state of Europe after the Great War. We'll also look at the rise of fascism via the auspices of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, and we'll set the stage for the war to come.\n\nSources\n-Smith, Bonnie G.

Today we're talking about the economic cultural recovery of the 1920s, and the economic depression of the 1930s, and the fragile state of Europe after the Great War. We'll also look at the rise of fascism via the auspices of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, and we'll set the stage for the war to come.\n\nSources\n-Smith, Bonnie G.

                    "description": "World War I was a total war for millions of people in Europe. Many men were enlisted in the fighting, but the war work had implications for the daily lives of a huge number of Europeans. Women entered the workforce in huge numbers, and for a lot of people, the battles raged through their towns, cities, and even their homes. \n\nIn addition to learning about the homefronts of the war, we're going to look at how the war ended, and how the Paris Peace Conference and the treaties that resulted did little to heal the societal wounds of the war, and in many ways set the stage for the next big war.\n\nSources\n\n-Akin, Yigit.   \u201cWar, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War,\u201d  Journal of Women\u2019s History.

Today we'll look at how Italy and Germany pulled it together in the second half of the 1800s. You'll learn about Guisseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuelle, Otto von Bismarck, Wilhelm I, and a whole heck of a lot about the development of modern politics.\n\nSources\n-Hunt, Lynn.

                "description": "In the aftermath of the revolutions and upheaval in 18th and early 19th century Europe, there was a hunger for reform across the continent. Reformers like Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, and Auguste Comte proposed radical new ideas, and at the same time, regular people began to stand up and ask for greater equality, and a louder voice in how they were governed. Results were mixed, but a lot of the ideas that emerged during this time are still echoing in our world today.\n\nSources\n\n-Hosking, Geoffrey. Russia: People and Empire.

                    "description": "In the aftermath of the revolutions and upheaval in 18th and early 19th century Europe, there was a hunger for reform across the continent. Reformers like Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, and Auguste Comte proposed radical new ideas, and at the same time, regular people began to stand up and ask for greater equality, and a louder voice in how they were governed. Results were mixed, but a lot of the ideas that emerged during this time are still echoing in our world today.\n\nSources\n\n-Hosking, Geoffrey. Russia: People and Empire.

                "description": "The end of the Napoleonic Wars left the great powers of Europe shaken. Judging from the destruction that had been wrought across the continent, it seemed to the powers that be that the Enlightenment had liberated the people, and led to disaster. So, everybody got together in Vienna to have a Congress, and to try to put Europe \"right\" again. By \"right\" I mean they wanted to go back to the old days of kings, queens, and nobles running the show. But this new yearning for the past pervaded the continent. Roomanticism arose at the same time, looking back at (imagined) golden age of Medieval Times. Today we'll talk about the Congress of Vienna, The Holy Alliance, and the Romantic movement across the arts.\n\nSources\n\n-Blanning, Tim.  The Romantic Revolution: A History.

                    "description": "The end of the Napoleonic Wars left the great powers of Europe shaken. Judging from the destruction that had been wrought across the continent, it seemed to the powers that be that the Enlightenment had liberated the people, and led to disaster. So, everybody got together in Vienna to have a Congress, and to try to put Europe \"right\" again. By \"right\" I mean they wanted to go back to the old days of kings, queens, and nobles running the show. But this new yearning for the past pervaded the continent. Roomanticism arose at the same time, looking back at (imagined) golden age of Medieval Times. Today we'll talk about the Congress of Vienna, The Holy Alliance, and the Romantic movement across the arts.\n\nSources\n\n-Blanning, Tim.  The Romantic Revolution: A History.

This week, we're learning how monarchs across Europe were influenced by those ideas. Adoption of Enlightenment ideas across Europe was...uneven, to say the least. In this episode you'll learn about Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Dynasty, and Joseph II, her successor. We'll also get into the impact the Enlightenment had on a series of Louis in France.\n\n\nSources\n\n-Elliot, John H. Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America, 1492-1830.

                    "description": "Last time we learned about the Enlightenment, and the philosophers and thinkers whose ideas would shape governance for hundred of years. This week, we're learning how monarchs across Europe were influenced by those ideas. Adoption of Enlightenment ideas across Europe was...uneven, to say the least. In this episode you'll learn about Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Dynasty, and Joseph II, her successor. We'll also get into the impact the Enlightenment had on a series of Louis in France.\n\n\nSources\n\n-Elliot, John H. Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America, 1492-1830.

The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, The Ottoman Empire, and Russia were all competing at the eastern end of the continent/landmass of Europe at during the 16th century. You'll learn about the various Ivans in Russia, and the Time of Trouble that followed them, and you'll learn about the Ottomans' expansion into Europe. You'll also learn how the great power you may not have heard of, Poland-Lithuania was right in the middle of all these events, from the rise of the False Dmitry to the Battle of Vienna.\n\nSources\n-Hosking, Geoffrey A.

                    "description": "While the focus has been on Western Europe so far, there has also been a lot going on in Eastern Europe, which we'll be looking at today. The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, The Ottoman Empire, and Russia were all competing at the eastern end of the continent/landmass of Europe at during the 16th century. You'll learn about the various Ivans in Russia, and the Time of Trouble that followed them, and you'll learn about the Ottomans' expansion into Europe. You'll also learn how the great power you may not have heard of, Poland-Lithuania was right in the middle of all these events, from the rise of the False Dmitry to the Battle of Vienna.\n\nSources\n-Hosking, Geoffrey A.

                "description": "You may have noticed that the internet is terrible at religious discourse. Well, this is not a new phenomenon. In the early 16th century, the Roman Catholic church dominated Christianity in Europe, and the institution was starting to show some cracks. Tensions mounted and protests grew, and eventually, the Protestant Reformation happened. Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, but the Reformation doesn't exactly begin with Luther, and it certainly doesn't end with him. Today, we're looking at how and why the Catholic church in Europe split, first into two sects, and eventually into a LOT of sects.\n\n#crashcourse #europeanhistory #history\n\nSources:\nHunt, Lynn et al.

                    "description": "You may have noticed that the internet is terrible at religious discourse. Well, this is not a new phenomenon. In the early 16th century, the Roman Catholic church dominated Christianity in Europe, and the institution was starting to show some cracks. Tensions mounted and protests grew, and eventually, the Protestant Reformation happened. Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, but the Reformation doesn't exactly begin with Luther, and it certainly doesn't end with him. Today, we're looking at how and why the Catholic church in Europe split, first into two sects, and eventually into a LOT of sects.\n\n#crashcourse #europeanhistory #history\n\nSources:\nHunt, Lynn et al.

Noh, and its counterpart Kyogen are some of the most revered theater forms in Japan, and are still performed today. Today you'll learn how Noh grew out of traditional Shinto dances, what a Noh theater looks like, and how audiences managed to sit through 8 hour performance in the days before memory foam theater seats. (hint: it was the Kyogen)\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

And 2. Is it spelled -re or -er? Well, there's a clue to question two in the title of the video. The first question is a little trickier. We'll look at some of the historical definitions of theater, and investigate some of the ways people have thought about theater in different times and places in the world. \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

We\u2019ll look at education through the lenses of some sociological paradigms: structural functionalist approaches (including some of the manifest and latent functions associated with education), and a symbolic interactionist approach to education that shows us how self-fulfilling prophecies in educational settings contribute to differences in academic outcomes for students.\n\nCrash Course is made with Adobe Creative Cloud.

                "description": "Hello, world! Welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So today, we\u2019re going to take a look at computing\u2019s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we\u2019ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps://about.me/carrieannephilbin\n\nWant more Crash Course in person?

                    "description": "Hello, world! Welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So today, we\u2019re going to take a look at computing\u2019s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we\u2019ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps://about.me/carrieannephilbin\n\nWant more Crash Course in person?

We talk a lot about bridges in Physics. Why? Because there is A LOT of practical physics that can be learned from the planning and construction of them. In this episode of Crash Course Physics, Shini talks to us about a particular mistake made in engineering the  Millennium Bridge which allows us to talk about simple harmonic motion. \n\n--\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\n--\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

                "description": "Today Craig finishes up our series on U.S. Government and Politics by talking about both the least and most important aspect of government: foreign policy. Foreign policy is important because it has the potential to affect the largest number of people, but at the same time, it tends to play a minimal role in our perception of the government (unless we\u2019re at war). Foreign policy addresses diplomacy, security, human rights, economics, and the environment at a global scale, and we\u2019re going to talk about how our government has approached each of these policies in the past and which it tends to hold most important. As with all things political, the decisions made in fulfilling these policies can be pretty controversial, especially when considering that the President often has the last word in these issues. \n\nWe hope this series has helped you better understand the way the U.S. government works and hopefully encouraged you to participate in the political process - here or wherever you may live. Thank you so much for watching!   \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nAdditional support is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

                    "description": "Today Craig finishes up our series on U.S. Government and Politics by talking about both the least and most important aspect of government: foreign policy. Foreign policy is important because it has the potential to affect the largest number of people, but at the same time, it tends to play a minimal role in our perception of the government (unless we\u2019re at war). Foreign policy addresses diplomacy, security, human rights, economics, and the environment at a global scale, and we\u2019re going to talk about how our government has approached each of these policies in the past and which it tends to hold most important. As with all things political, the decisions made in fulfilling these policies can be pretty controversial, especially when considering that the President often has the last word in these issues. \n\nWe hope this series has helped you better understand the way the U.S. government works and hopefully encouraged you to participate in the political process - here or wherever you may live. Thank you so much for watching!   \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nAdditional support is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

Now this is all pretty controversial and we're going to talk about it, as this is a long way from the federal government handed down by the framers of the constitution. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

We're going to talk about the government's goals for the U.S. economy and the policies it employs to achieve those goals. Ever since the New Deal, we've seen an increased role of the government within the economy - even with the deregulation initiatives of President Carter and Reagan in the 80's. Now this is all pretty controversial and we're going to talk about it, as this is a long way from the federal government handed down by the framers of the constitution. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

Stellar mass black holes form when a very massive star dies, and its core collapses. The core has to be more than about 2.8 times the Sun\u2019s mass to form a black hole. Black holes come in different sizes, but for all of them, the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, so nothing can escape, not matter or light. They don\u2019t wander the Universe gobbling everything down around them; their gravity is only really intense very close to them. Tides near a stellar mass black hole will spaghettify you, and time slows down when you get near a black hole \u2014 not that this helps much if you\u2019re falling in.\n\nCrash Course Astronomy Poster: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nHow Stellar Mass Black Holes Are Formed 1:03\nThe Core 1:43\nNothing Can Escape Once It\u2019s Inside 2:29\nGravity Intensifies The Closer You Get 3:33\nSpaghettification 6:01\nTime Will Slow Down Near A Black Hole 8:01\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nWhite Dwarf Pulses Like a Pulsar http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/whitedwarf_pulsar.html [credit: NASA, Casey Reed]\nSwift Reveals New Phenomenon in a Neutron Star http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/new-phenom.html#.Vc4isflVhBd [credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center]\nBlack Holes - Monsters in Space https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_Holes_-_Monsters_in_Space.jpg [credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech, Wikimedia Commons]\nWhat if the Sun became a black hole?

Neutrons stars are incredibly dense, spin rapidly, and have very strong magnetic fields. Some of them we see as pulsars, flashing in brightness as they spin. Neutrons stars with the strongest magnetic fields are called magnetars, and are capable of colossal bursts of energy that can be detected over vast distances.\n\nCrash Course Astronomy Poster: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nA Star Can Collapse to Form a Neutron Star 0:59\nNeutron Star Characteristics 2:24\nPulsars 5:56\nMagnetars 8:15\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nStar Burst https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=11447 [credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center]\nX-ray Images of G292.0+1.8 http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/animations/snr.html/?page=8 [credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/Penn State/S.Park et al.; Optical: Pal.Obs.

Nachos can provide us with energy and raw materials, by first ingesting something nutritious, propelling it through the alimentary canal where it will be mechanically broken down, and chemically digested by enzymes until my cells can absorb their monomers and use them to make whatever they need. And eventually, there will be pooping.\n\nTable of Contents\nIngestion 6:24\nPropulsion 7:00\nMechanical Breakdown 7:38\nDigestion 8:01\nAbsorption 8:30\nDefecation 8:50\n\n\n***\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

We'll finish up with the limitations of these protections and discuss one group of people in particular that aren't protected equally - students. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

Now, the fourth amendment says that you have the right to be protected against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" but what exactly does this mean? Well, it's complicated. The police often need warrants issued with proof of probable cause, but this isn't always the case - such as when you're pulled over for a moving violation. We'll finish up with the limitations of these protections and discuss one group of people in particular that aren't protected equally - students. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they are actually very different. Our civil liberties, contained in the Bill of Rights, once only protected us from the federal government, but slowly these liberties have been incorporated to protect us from the states. We\u2019ll take a look at how this has happened and the supreme court cases that got us here. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

                "description": "Today, Craig Benzine is going to dive into the factors that influence judicial decisions. As you may have noticed, the Supreme Court recently handed down some pretty big decisions on same-sex marriage (in Obergefell v Hodges) and the Affordable Care Act (in King v. Burwell). Now, it's important to remember that these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but influenced by the other branches of government, political affiliations, and past court decisions. We\u2019re also talk about a judge\u2019s judicial philosophy - that is their relative restraint or activism in making decisions on laws. Judicial restraint is often equated with conservatism, but as we\u2019ll show you, this is not always the case. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

                    "description": "Today, Craig Benzine is going to dive into the factors that influence judicial decisions. As you may have noticed, the Supreme Court recently handed down some pretty big decisions on same-sex marriage (in Obergefell v Hodges) and the Affordable Care Act (in King v. Burwell). Now, it's important to remember that these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but influenced by the other branches of government, political affiliations, and past court decisions. We\u2019re also talk about a judge\u2019s judicial philosophy - that is their relative restraint or activism in making decisions on laws. Judicial restraint is often equated with conservatism, but as we\u2019ll show you, this is not always the case. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

The Kuiper Belt is a donut shape aligned with the plane of the solar system; the scattered disk is more eccentric and is the source of short period comets; and the Oort Cloud which surrounds the solar system out to great distances is the source of long-period comets. These bodies all probably formed closer into the Sun, and got flung out to the solar system\u2019s suburbs by gravitational interactions with the outer planets.\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nIcy Bodies That Can Become Comets 0:27\nThe Kuiper Belt is a Donut Shape Aligned With the Plane of the Solar System 2:57\nThe Scattered Disk is More Eccentric and the Source of Short Period Comets 4:26\nOort Cloud Surrounds Our Solar System and is the Source of Long-Period Comets 4:04\nThese Bodies Probably Formed Near the Sun and Dispersed Through Gravitational Interactions 5:41\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nHD Long Exposure Star Timelapse https://vimeo.com/34172172 [credit: Jeffrey Beach, Beachfront B-Roll]\nFine Structure in the Comet\u2019s Jets http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/01/16/fine-structure-in-the-comets-jets/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk#mediaviewer/File:Artist%E2%80%99s_Impression_of_a_Baby_Star_Still_Surrounded_by_a_Protoplanetary_Disc.jpg [credit: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA]\nArtist's impression of a protoplanetary disk.

Out past Neptune are vast reservoirs of icy bodies that can become comets if they get poked into the inner solar system. The Kuiper Belt is a donut shape aligned with the plane of the solar system; the scattered disk is more eccentric and is the source of short period comets; and the Oort Cloud which surrounds the solar system out to great distances is the source of long-period comets. These bodies all probably formed closer into the Sun, and got flung out to the solar system\u2019s suburbs by gravitational interactions with the outer planets.\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nIcy Bodies That Can Become Comets 0:27\nThe Kuiper Belt is a Donut Shape Aligned With the Plane of the Solar System 2:57\nThe Scattered Disk is More Eccentric and the Source of Short Period Comets 4:26\nOort Cloud Surrounds Our Solar System and is the Source of Long-Period Comets 4:04\nThese Bodies Probably Formed Near the Sun and Dispersed Through Gravitational Interactions 5:41\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nHD Long Exposure Star Timelapse https://vimeo.com/34172172 [credit: Jeffrey Beach, Beachfront B-Roll]\nFine Structure in the Comet\u2019s Jets http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/01/16/fine-structure-in-the-comets-jets/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk#mediaviewer/File:Artist%E2%80%99s_Impression_of_a_Baby_Star_Still_Surrounded_by_a_Protoplanetary_Disc.jpg [credit: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA]\nArtist's impression of a protoplanetary disk.

When they get near the Sun the ice turns into gas, forming the long tail, and also releases dust that forms a different tail. We\u2019ve visited comets up close and found them to be lumpy, with vents in the surface that release the gas as ice sublimates. Eons ago, comets (and asteroids) may have brought a lot of water to Earth -- as well as the ingredients for life.\n\n--\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "Today on Crash Course Astronomy, Phil explains comets. Comets are chunks of ice and rock that orbit the Sun. When they get near the Sun the ice turns into gas, forming the long tail, and also releases dust that forms a different tail. We\u2019ve visited comets up close and found them to be lumpy, with vents in the surface that release the gas as ice sublimates. Eons ago, comets (and asteroids) may have brought a lot of water to Earth -- as well as the ingredients for life.\n\n--\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                "description": "EPISODE DESCRIPTION\n\nThis week, Stan Muller teaches you the basics of copyright in the United States. Copyright law is territorial, so we're going to cover the system we know the most about, and that's the US. Stan will talk about what kind of ideas can be copyrighted, who can get a copyright, and what protections the copyright grants. We'll also talk about the always contentious and seemingly ever-growing term of copyright. Stan will also teach you about the low bar for creativity, which means that original work doesn't have to be all that original, and he'll also touch on the problems with copyright in the modern world.\n\nThe Magic 8 Ball is a registered trademark of the Mattel corporation.\n\nCitation 1: Title 17 United States Code, section 101\nCitation 2: 17 USC 101\nCitation 3: 17 USC 101\n\nCrash Course is now on Patreon!

                    "description": "EPISODE DESCRIPTION\n\nThis week, Stan Muller teaches you the basics of copyright in the United States. Copyright law is territorial, so we're going to cover the system we know the most about, and that's the US. Stan will talk about what kind of ideas can be copyrighted, who can get a copyright, and what protections the copyright grants. We'll also talk about the always contentious and seemingly ever-growing term of copyright. Stan will also teach you about the low bar for creativity, which means that original work doesn't have to be all that original, and he'll also touch on the problems with copyright in the modern world.\n\nThe Magic 8 Ball is a registered trademark of the Mattel corporation.\n\nCitation 1: Title 17 United States Code, section 101\nCitation 2: 17 USC 101\nCitation 3: 17 USC 101\n\nCrash Course is now on Patreon!

In theory, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Brach are designed to keep each other in check, and to keep any branch from becoming too powerful. In reality, the system was designed to keep the president from becoming some kind of autocrat. For the most part, it has worked. Craig will call in the clones to explain which powers belong to which branches, and to reveal some secret perks that the Supreme Court justices enjoy.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nInstagram - http://instagram.com/thecrashcourse\nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon at http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse",

In theory, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Brach are designed to keep each other in check, and to keep any branch from becoming too powerful. In reality, the system was designed to keep the president from becoming some kind of autocrat. For the most part, it has worked. Craig will call in the clones to explain which powers belong to which branches, and to reveal some secret perks that the Supreme Court justices enjoy.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nInstagram - http://instagram.com/thecrashcourse\nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon at http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse"

Today John talks about water in the context of classical civilizations, but not like Greece or Rome or something. We're talking about the Maya civilization in Central America, and the Khmer civilization in what is now Cambodia. So this is an awesome video, OK?\n\nYou can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

It turns out people can't live without water, which means it's absolutely necessary for civilization. Today John talks about water in the context of classical civilizations, but not like Greece or Rome or something. We're talking about the Maya civilization in Central America, and the Khmer civilization in what is now Cambodia. So this is an awesome video, OK?\n\nYou can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

Islamist movements are in the news a lot lately, but how did that happen. John will point out that Islam has alway been tied to political movements. Mohammed was not only a religious leader, he led an empire. So how did this lead to modern movements like ISIS? Islam has traditionally been a pretty egalitarian religion, and its scriptures value peace, so it is surprising in a lot of ways that such a violent fundamentalist movement would come out of it. What is a caliphate? What is a Caliph? John will teach you all about it. Take it easy in the comments, y'all.

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about how Islam has interacted with politics during it's history, and how it continues to do so today. Islamist movements are in the news a lot lately, but how did that happen. John will point out that Islam has alway been tied to political movements. Mohammed was not only a religious leader, he led an empire. So how did this lead to modern movements like ISIS? Islam has traditionally been a pretty egalitarian religion, and its scriptures value peace, so it is surprising in a lot of ways that such a violent fundamentalist movement would come out of it. What is a caliphate? What is a Caliph? John will teach you all about it. Take it easy in the comments, y'all. Be kind and respectful to each other.\n\nYou can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

Free is nice, but if you can afford to pay a little every month, it really helps us to continue producing this content.\n\nIn which John Green teaches you about the poetry of Sylvia Plath. When a lot of people think about Sylvia Plath, they think about her struggles with mental illness and her eventual suicide. Her actual work can get lost in the shuffle a bit, so this video really tries to focus on the poetry. You'll learn about Sylvia Plath's role as a feminist poet, and you'll also learn about her extraordinary ability to recreate the experiences of real life in beautiful and relatable way.\n\nHear John read all of Sylvia Plath's \"Lady Lazarus\" here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auP1bHAglU0&feature=youtu.be",

When a lot of people think about Sylvia Plath, they think about her struggles with mental illness and her eventual suicide. Her actual work can get lost in the shuffle a bit, so this video really tries to focus on the poetry. You'll learn about Sylvia Plath's role as a feminist poet, and you'll also learn about her extraordinary ability to recreate the experiences of real life in beautiful and relatable way.\n\nHear John read all of Sylvia Plath's \"Lady Lazarus\" here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auP1bHAglU0&feature=youtu.be"

Langston Hughes was a poet and playwright in the first half of the 20th century, and he was involved in the Harlem Renaissance, which was a cultural movement among African Americans of the time that produced all kinds of great works in literature, poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and other areas. The Harlem Renaissance mainly happened in Harlem, the traditionally black neighborhood in upper Manhattan in New York City. Langston Hughes was primarily known as a poet, but he was involved deeply in the movement itself as well.

Bush. It was neither the best of times, nor the worst of times. On the domestic front, the first president Bush inherited the relative prosperity of the later Reagan years, and watched that prosperity evaporate. That was about all the interest Bush 41 had, domestically, so let's move to foreign policy, which was a bigger deal at this time. The biggie was the end of the Cold War, which is the title of the video, so you know it's important. The collapse of the Soviet Union was the biggest deal of Bush's term, and history has assigned the credit to Ronald Reagan. We give the guy a break, and say that he helped. He was certainly expert in foreign policy, having been and envoy to China, ambassador to the United Nations,  and head of the CIA. Bush also oversaw the first Gulf War, which was something of a success, in that the primary mission was accomplished, and the vast majority of the troops were home in short order. It didn't do much to address some of the other problems in the region, but we'll get to that in the next few weeks. Along with all this, you'll learn about Bush's actions, or lack thereof, in Somalia and the Balkans, and you'll even be given an opportunity to read Bush's lips.\n\nThanks to Michael Williams at http://www.mylifeinplastic.com for the Barbies.\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD!

Bush. It was neither the best of times, nor the worst of times. On the domestic front, the first president Bush inherited the relative prosperity of the later Reagan years, and watched that prosperity evaporate. That was about all the interest Bush 41 had, domestically, so let's move to foreign policy, which was a bigger deal at this time. The biggie was the end of the Cold War, which is the title of the video, so you know it's important. The collapse of the Soviet Union was the biggest deal of Bush's term, and history has assigned the credit to Ronald Reagan. We give the guy a break, and say that he helped. He was certainly expert in foreign policy, having been and envoy to China, ambassador to the United Nations,  and head of the CIA. Bush also oversaw the first Gulf War, which was something of a success, in that the primary mission was accomplished, and the vast majority of the troops were home in short order. It didn't do much to address some of the other problems in the region, but we'll get to that in the next few weeks. Along with all this, you'll learn about Bush's actions, or lack thereof, in Somalia and the Balkans, and you'll even be given an opportunity to read Bush's lips.\n\nThanks to Michael Williams at http://www.mylifeinplastic.com for the Barbies.\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD!

A sort of perfect storm of events, it combined the continuing decline of America's manufacturing base and the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, and brought about an stagnant economy, paired with high inflation. Economists with a flair for neologisms and portamenteau words called this \"stagflation,\" and it made people miserable. Two presidential administrations were scuttled at least in part by these economic woes; both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter are considered failed presidents for many reasons, but largely because of an inability to improve the economy.

A sort of perfect storm of events, it combined the continuing decline of America's manufacturing base and the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, and brought about an stagnant economy, paired with high inflation. Economists with a flair for neologisms and portamenteau words called this \"stagflation,\" and it made people miserable. Two presidential administrations were scuttled at least in part by these economic woes; both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter are considered failed presidents for many reasons, but largely because of an inability to improve the economy.

By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD!

The Cold War was called cold because of the lack of actual fighting, but this is inaccurate. There was plenty of fighting, from Korea to Viet Nam to Afghanistan, but we'll get into that stuff next week. This week we'll talk about how the Cold War started. In short it grew out of World War II. Basically, the Soviets occupied eastern Europe, and the US supported western Europe. This setup would spill across the world, with client states on both sides.

The Cold War was called cold because of the lack of actual fighting, but this is inaccurate. There was plenty of fighting, from Korea to Viet Nam to Afghanistan, but we'll get into that stuff next week. This week we'll talk about how the Cold War started. In short it grew out of World War II. Basically, the Soviets occupied eastern Europe, and the US supported western Europe. This setup would spill across the world, with client states on both sides.

What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, \"The Gilded Age.\" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement. The Populists, who threw in their lot with William Jennings Bryan, never managed to get it together and win a presidency, and they faded after 1896.

What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, \"The Gilded Age.\" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement. The Populists, who threw in their lot with William Jennings Bryan, never managed to get it together and win a presidency, and they faded after 1896.

Immigrants flocked to the US from all over the world in this time period. Millions of Europeans moved to the US where they drove the growth of cities and manned the rapid industrialization that was taking place. In the western US many, many Chinese immigrants arrived to work on the railroad and in mines. As is often the case in the United States, the people who already lived in the US reacted kind of badly to this flood of immigrants. Some legislators tried to stem the flow of new arrivals, with mixed success. Grover Cleveland vetoed a general ban on immigration, but the leadership at the time did manage to get together to pass and anti-Chinese immigration law. Immigrants did win some important Supreme Court decisions upholding their rights, but in many ways, immigrants were treated as second class citizens. At the same time, the country was rapidly urbanizing. Cities were growing rapidly and industrial technology was developing new wonders all the time.

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about Reconstruction. After the divisive, destructive Civil War, Abraham Lincoln had a plan to reconcile the country and make it whole again. Then he got shot, Andrew Johnson took over, and the disagreements between Johnson and Congress ensured that Reconstruction would fail. The election of 1876 made the whole thing even more of a mess, and the country called it off, leaving the nation still very divided. John will talk about the gains made by African-Americans in the years after the Civil War, and how they lost those gains almost immediately when Reconstruction stopped. You'll learn about the Freedman's Bureau, the 14th and 15th amendments, and the disastrous election of 1876. John will explore the goals of Reconstruction, the successes and ultimate failure, and why his alma mater Kenyon College is better than Raoul's alma mater NYU.

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about Reconstruction. After the divisive, destructive Civil War, Abraham Lincoln had a plan to reconcile the country and make it whole again. Then he got shot, Andrew Johnson took over, and the disagreements between Johnson and Congress ensured that Reconstruction would fail. The election of 1876 made the whole thing even more of a mess, and the country called it off, leaving the nation still very divided. John will talk about the gains made by African-Americans in the years after the Civil War, and how they lost those gains almost immediately when Reconstruction stopped. You'll learn about the Freedman's Bureau, the 14th and 15th amendments, and the disastrous election of 1876. John will explore the goals of Reconstruction, the successes and ultimate failure, and why his alma mater Kenyon College is better than Raoul's alma mater NYU.

                "description": "In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. If you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:\nBattle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson\nThe Civil War by Shelby Foote\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. There were many causes of the American Civil War and events that led to disunion: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/causes-of-the-american-civil-war\nOnce the war started, its outcome was determined by the different abilities and resources of the divided North and South: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/a-nation-divided-north-vs-south\n\nfollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@br8ybrunch Support CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse",

                    "description": "In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. If you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:\nBattle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson\nThe Civil War by Shelby Foote\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

                "description": "In which John Green finally gets around to talking about some women's history. In the 19th Century, the United States was changing rapidly, as we noted in the recent Market Revolution and Reform Movements episodes. Things were also in a state of flux for women. The reform movements, which were in large part driven by women, gave these self-same women the idea that they could work on their own behalf, and radically improve the state of their own lives. So, while these women were working on prison reform, education reform, and abolition, they also started talking about equal rights, universal suffrage, temperance, and fair pay. Women like Susan B. Anthony, Carry Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the Grimk\u00e9s, and Lucretia Mott strove tirelessly to improve the lot of American women, and it worked, eventually. John will teach you about the Christian Temperance Union, the Seneca Falls Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and a whole bunch of other stuff that made life better for women.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Few women were as vocal for women's rights during the 19th century than Susan B. Anthony: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-life-s-work-of-susan-b-anthony\nAnthony worked for women's right to vote alongside great women like Sojourner Truth, who stressed the importance of intersectional feminism in her influential \u201cAin't I a Woman?\u201d Speech: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/ain-t-i-a-woman\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica Support CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse",

                    "description": "In which John Green finally gets around to talking about some women's history. In the 19th Century, the United States was changing rapidly, as we noted in the recent Market Revolution and Reform Movements episodes. Things were also in a state of flux for women. The reform movements, which were in large part driven by women, gave these self-same women the idea that they could work on their own behalf, and radically improve the state of their own lives. So, while these women were working on prison reform, education reform, and abolition, they also started talking about equal rights, universal suffrage, temperance, and fair pay. Women like Susan B. Anthony, Carry Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the Grimk\u00e9s, and Lucretia Mott strove tirelessly to improve the lot of American women, and it worked, eventually. John will teach you about the Christian Temperance Union, the Seneca Falls Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and a whole bunch of other stuff that made life better for women.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Few women were as vocal for women's rights during the 19th century than Susan B. Anthony: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-life-s-work-of-susan-b-anthony\nAnthony worked for women's right to vote alongside great women like Sojourner Truth, who stressed the importance of intersectional feminism in her influential \u201cAin't I a Woman?\u201d Speech: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/ain-t-i-a-woman\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica Support CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse"

The good news: when they are behaving themselves, it's extremely easy to describe their behavior theoretically, experimentally and mathematically.  The bad news is they almost never behave themselves.  \nIn this episode of Crash Course Chemistry, Hank tells how the work of some amazing thinkers combined to produce the Ideal Gas Law, how none of those people were Robert Boyle, and how the ideal gas equation allows you to find out pressure, volume, temperature or number of moles.

The good news: when they are behaving themselves, it's extremely easy to describe their behavior theoretically, experimentally and mathematically.  The bad news is they almost never behave themselves.  \nIn this episode of Crash Course Chemistry, Hank tells how the work of some amazing thinkers combined to produce the Ideal Gas Law, how none of those people were Robert Boyle, and how the ideal gas equation allows you to find out pressure, volume, temperature or number of moles.  You'll also get a quick introduction to a few jargon-y phrases to help you sound like you know what you're talking about.  \n\nTable of Contents\nIdeal Gas Law Equation 0:50\nEveryone But Robert Boyle 1:35\nIdeal Gas Law to Figure Out Things 6:16\nJargon Fun Time 7:46\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com Support CrashCourse on Subbable: http://subbable.com/crashcourse"

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about founding father and third president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is a somewhat controversial figure in American history, largely because he, like pretty much all humans, was a big bundle of contradictions. Jefferson was a slave-owner who couldn't decide if he liked slavery. He advocated for small government, but expanded federal power more than either of his presidential predecessor. He also idealized the independent farmer and demonized manufacturing, but put policies in place that would expand industrial production in the US. Controversy may ensue as we try to deviate a bit from the standard hagiography/slander story that usually told about old TJ. John explores Jefferson's election, his policies, and some of the new nation's (literally and figuratively) formative events that took place during Jefferson's presidency. In addition to all this, Napoleon drops in to sell Louisiana, John Marshall sets the course of the Supreme Court, and John Adams gets called a tiny tyrant.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Thomas Jefferson is remembered as the Founding Father responsible for saying all men are created equal in The Declaration of Independence: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-declaration-of-independence\nJefferson didn't always practice what he preached though, as seen in his mixed views on American Indians: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/excerpts-from-thomas-jefferson-s-writings-on-american-indians\n\nFollow us!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse\nhttp://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nhttp://www.twitter.com/crashcoursestan\nhttp://www.twitter.com/raoulmeyer\nhttp://www.twitter.com/thoughtbubbler\nhttp://www.twitter.com/saysdanica\n\nLike us!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse Support CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse",

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about founding father and third president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is a somewhat controversial figure in American history, largely because he, like pretty much all humans, was a big bundle of contradictions. Jefferson was a slave-owner who couldn't decide if he liked slavery. He advocated for small government, but expanded federal power more than either of his presidential predecessor. He also idealized the independent farmer and demonized manufacturing, but put policies in place that would expand industrial production in the US. Controversy may ensue as we try to deviate a bit from the standard hagiography/slander story that usually told about old TJ. John explores Jefferson's election, his policies, and some of the new nation's (literally and figuratively) formative events that took place during Jefferson's presidency. In addition to all this, Napoleon drops in to sell Louisiana, John Marshall sets the course of the Supreme Court, and John Adams gets called a tiny tyrant.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Thomas Jefferson is remembered as the Founding Father responsible for saying all men are created equal in The Declaration of Independence: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-declaration-of-independence\nJefferson didn't always practice what he preached though, as seen in his mixed views on American Indians: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/excerpts-from-thomas-jefferson-s-writings-on-american-indians\n\nFollow us!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse\nhttp://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nhttp://www.twitter.com/crashcoursestan\nhttp://www.twitter.com/raoulmeyer\nhttp://www.twitter.com/thoughtbubbler\nhttp://www.twitter.com/saysdanica\n\nLike us!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse Support CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse"

George Washington was elected president with no opposition, everything was new and exciting, and everyone just got along. For several months. Then the contentious debate about the nature of the United States began, and it continues to this day. Washington and his lackey/handler Alexander Hamilton pursued an elitist program of federalism. They attempted to strengthen the central government, create a strong nation-state, and leave less of the governance to the states, They wanted to create debt, encourage manufacturing, and really modernize the new nation/ The opposition, creatively known as the anti-federalists, wanted to build some kind of agrarian pseudo-paradise where every (white) man could have his own farm, and live a free, self-reliant life. The founding father who epitomized this view was Thomas Jefferson. By the time Adams became president, the anti-federalists had gotten the memo about how alienating a name like anti-federalist can be. It's so much more appealing to voters if your party is for something rather than being defined by what you're against, you know? In any case, Jefferson and his acolytes changed their name to the Democratic-Republican Party, which covered a lot of bases, and proceeded to protest nearly everything Adams did. Lest you think this week is all boring politics,you'll be thrilled to hear this episode has a Whiskey Rebellion, a Quasi-War, anti-French sentiment, some controversial treaties, and something called the XYZ Affair, which sounds very exciting.

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about the roots of the American Revolution. The Revolution did not start on July 4, 1776. The Revolutionary War didn't start on July 4 either. (as you remember, I'm sure, the Revolution and the Revolutionary War are not the same thing) The shooting started on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and/or Concord, MA. Or the shooting started with the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. At least we can pin down the Declaration of Independence to July 4, 1776. Except that most of the signers didn't sign until August 2. The point is that the beginning of the Revolution is very complex and hard to pin down. John will lead you through the bramble of taxes, royal decrees, acts of parliament, colonial responses, and various congresses. We'll start with the end of the Seven Years War, and the bill that the British ran up fighting the war. This led to taxes on colonial trade, which led to colonists demanding representation, which led to revolution. It all seems very complicated, but Crash Course will get you through it in about 12 minutes.\n\nTurn on the captions.

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about the roots of the American Revolution. The Revolution did not start on July 4, 1776. The Revolutionary War didn't start on July 4 either. (as you remember, I'm sure, the Revolution and the Revolutionary War are not the same thing) The shooting started on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and/or Concord, MA. Or the shooting started with the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. At least we can pin down the Declaration of Independence to July 4, 1776. Except that most of the signers didn't sign until August 2. The point is that the beginning of the Revolution is very complex and hard to pin down. John will lead you through the bramble of taxes, royal decrees, acts of parliament, colonial responses, and various congresses. We'll start with the end of the Seven Years War, and the bill that the British ran up fighting the war. This led to taxes on colonial trade, which led to colonists demanding representation, which led to revolution. It all seems very complicated, but Crash Course will get you through it in about 12 minutes.\n\nTurn on the captions.

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about relations between the early English colonists and the native people the encountered in the New World. In short, these relations were poor. As soon as they arrived, the English were in conflict with the native people. At Jamestown, Captain John Smith briefly managed to get the colony on pretty solid footing with the local tribes, but it didn't last, and a long series of wars with the natives ensued. This pattern would continue in US history, with settlers pushing into native lands and pushing the inhabitants further west. In this episode, you'll learn about Wahunsunacawh (who the English called Powhatan), his daughter Pocahontas, King Philip's (aka Metacom) War, and the Mystic Massacre. By and large, the history of the Natives and the English was not a happy one, even Thanksgiving wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about relations between the early English colonists and the native people the encountered in the New World. In short, these relations were poor. As soon as they arrived, the English were in conflict with the native people. At Jamestown, Captain John Smith briefly managed to get the colony on pretty solid footing with the local tribes, but it didn't last, and a long series of wars with the natives ensued. This pattern would continue in US history, with settlers pushing into native lands and pushing the inhabitants further west. In this episode, you'll learn about Wahunsunacawh (who the English called Powhatan), his daughter Pocahontas, King Philip's (aka Metacom) War, and the Mystic Massacre. By and large, the history of the Natives and the English was not a happy one, even Thanksgiving wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

He covers the first permanent English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the various theocracies in Massachusetts, the feudal kingdom in Maryland, and even a bit about the spooky lost colony at Roanoke Island. What were the English doing in America, anyway? Lots of stuff. In Virginia, the colonists were largely there to make money. In Maryland, the idea was to create a a colony for Catholics who wanted to be serfs of the Lords Baltimore. In Massachusetts, the Pilgrims and Puritans came to America to find a place where they could freely persecute those who didn't share their beliefs. But there was a healthy profit motive in Massachusetts as well. Profits were thin at first, and so were the colonists. Trouble growing food and trouble with the natives kept the early colonies from success. Before long though, the colonists started cultivating tobacco, which was a win for everyone involved if you ignore the lung cancer angle. So kick back, light up a smoke, and learn how America became profitable. DON'T SMOKE, THOUGH!

In Maryland, the idea was to create a a colony for Catholics who wanted to be serfs of the Lords Baltimore. In Massachusetts, the Pilgrims and Puritans came to America to find a place where they could freely persecute those who didn't share their beliefs. But there was a healthy profit motive in Massachusetts as well. Profits were thin at first, and so were the colonists. Trouble growing food and trouble with the natives kept the early colonies from success. Before long though, the colonists started cultivating tobacco, which was a win for everyone involved if you ignore the lung cancer angle. So kick back, light up a smoke, and learn how America became profitable. DON'T SMOKE, THOUGH! THAT WAS A JOKE!\n\nTun on the captions, you'll like them!\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.\n\nTurn on the captions.

Sure, John explores the creepy biographical details of Dickinson's life, but he also gets into why her poems have remained relevant over the decades. John discusses Dickinson's language, the structure of her work, her cake recipes. He also talks about Dickinson's famously eccentric punctuation, which again ends up relating to her cake recipes. Also, Dickinson's coconut cake recipe is included.

                    "description": "In which John Green concludes the Crash Course Literature mini-series with an examination of the poetry of Emily Dickinson. Sure, John explores the creepy biographical details of Dickinson's life, but he also gets into why her poems have remained relevant over the decades. John discusses Dickinson's language, the structure of her work, her cake recipes. He also talks about Dickinson's famously eccentric punctuation, which again ends up relating to her cake recipes. Also, Dickinson's coconut cake recipe is included. Also, here are links to some of the poems discussed in the video:\n\nFaith is a Fine Invention: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177763\n\nI Heard a Fly Buzz--When I Died: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174972\n\nBefore I Got My Eye Put Out: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182805\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica \n\nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse"

John will argue that reading is about effectively communicating with other people. Unlike a direct communication though, the writer has to communicate with a stranger, through time and space, with only \"dry dead words on a page.\" So how's that going to work? Find out with Crash Course Literature! Also, readers are empowered during the open letter, so that's pretty cool.\n\nThe Reading List!\n\nRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare: http://dft.ba/-shakespearerj\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F.

John will argue that reading is about effectively communicating with other people. Unlike a direct communication though, the writer has to communicate with a stranger, through time and space, with only \"dry dead words on a page.\" So how's that going to work? Find out with Crash Course Literature! Also, readers are empowered during the open letter, so that's pretty cool.\n\nThe Reading List!\n\nRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare: http://dft.ba/-shakespearerj\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F.

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.\n\nAlso, you should turn on the captions.\n\nThanks to Destin from Smarter Every Day for the cotton footage! http://www.youtube.com/destinws2\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@johngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.\n\nAlso, you should turn on the captions.\n\nThanks to Destin from Smarter Every Day for the cotton footage! http://www.youtube.com/destinws2\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@johngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse"

Instead, it solved nothing and set the stage for the world to be back at war just a couple of decades later. As an added bonus, World War I changed the way people look at the world, and normalized cynicism and irony. John will teach you how the assassination of an Austrian Archduke kicked off a new kind of war that involved more nations and more people than any war that came before. New technology like machine guns, airplanes, tanks, and poison gas made the killing more efficient than ever. Trench warfare and modern weapons led to battles in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed in a day, with no ground gained for either side. World War I washed away the last vestiges of 19th century Romanticism and paved the way for the 20th century modernism that we all know and find to be cold and off-putting.

European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the \"sun never set on the British Empire.\" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called \"primitive\" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise. \n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! \u202ahttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! \u202ahttp://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the \"sun never set on the British Empire.\" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called \"primitive\" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise. \n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! \u202ahttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! \u202ahttp://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse"

Although freedom was breaking out all over, many of the societies that were touting these ideas relied on slave labor. Few places in the world relied so heavily on slave labor as Saint-Domingue, France's most profitable colony. Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue's population, and in 1789 they couldn't help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled. This led to not one but two revolutions, and ended up with France, the rebels, Britain, and Spain all fighting in the territory. Spoiler alert: the slaves won. So how did the slaves of what would become Haiti throw off the yoke of one of the world's great empires?
