The video gave a fundamental background to the notations used in representing the solutions of some Functions, which is usually the difficulty encountered by many students. \n\nWhat is Real number and its contents (Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Rational Number and Irrational Number) used in Functions was explained in detail, including Set Builders Notations, Interval Notations and Inequality Notations. Examples were given to explain each notation and how it can be used in Functions. The final part of the video show two solutions to a Domain and Range question, which will be continued in the next video.",

The video gave a fundamental background to the notations used in representing the solutions of some Functions, which is usually the difficulty encountered by many students. \n\nWhat is Real number and its contents (Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Rational Number and Irrational Number) used in Functions was explained in detail, including Set Builders Notations, Interval Notations and Inequality Notations. Examples were given to explain each notation and how it can be used in Functions. The final part of the video show two solutions to a Domain and Range question, which will be continued in the next video."

This initiation was used in many other areas of life such as 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. Also, concentrating on 20% vital few tasks will produce 80% of effective result. While 80% of trivial tasks will produce 20% of result as well.\n\n\nThis principle and law gained a world wide recognition. This principle alos serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced.\n\nThis video gave a brief lecture on Vilfredo Pareto principle and how to tabulate and plot the graph of Pareto chart in a step by step approach.\n\nThis video is recommended and applicable in engineering, business, medicine, mathematics, statistics, economics, social sciences and many human endeavours.",

This initiation was used in many other areas of life such as 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. Also, concentrating on 20% vital few tasks will produce 80% of effective result. While 80% of trivial tasks will produce 20% of result as well.\n\n\nThis principle and law gained a world wide recognition. This principle alos serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced.\n\nThis video gave a brief lecture on Vilfredo Pareto principle and how to tabulate and plot the graph of Pareto chart in a step by step approach.\n\nThis video is recommended and applicable in engineering, business, medicine, mathematics, statistics, economics, social sciences and many human endeavours."

You will learn some basic guidelines on how to use a GPS receiver on site, and also, some basic rules on how to draw an isoline profile. Afterwards, you will learn how to draw points covering equal elevation to form contour lines. From this profile, you can predict the feature elevation. This is an introductory lecture series into Surveying in Construction and Civil Engineering course applicable in real life scenarios. Many of the equipment we use in remote areas on sites, have GPS tracking system inserting in them, and at times, displays readings that enable us work on construction sites. Its important construction professionals understand these readings as they make use of them."

The first few weeks in a Calculus class can be daunting, however, understanding some basic concepts help toward overcoming the initial challenges. This video will help beginners to understanding the concept of why they do take limits when solving functions, and the first principles. Other videos of the methods of solving derivatives using product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, implicit rule, parametric function, and so on are in another video series. Afterwards, watch out for the integration videos.",

The first few weeks in a Calculus class can be daunting, however, understanding some basic concepts help toward overcoming the initial challenges. This video will help beginners to understanding the concept of why they do take limits when solving functions, and the first principles. Other videos of the methods of solving derivatives using product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, implicit rule, parametric function, and so on are in another video series. Afterwards, watch out for the integration videos."

Those who had the privilege of hearing him speak can attest to the elegance and common sense of his material. It is no coincidence, then, that he is still widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time, and thought of by many as a national treasure.\n He authored countless books and audio and video programs, and helped motivate and shape an entire generation of personal-development trainers and hundreds of executives from America\u2019s top corporations.\n\nJim Rohn shared his message with more than 6,000 audiences and over 5 million people all over the world. He received numerous industry awards including the coveted National Speakers Association CPAE Award and  the Master of Influence Award. Jim\u2019s philosophies and influence continue to have worldwide impact."
