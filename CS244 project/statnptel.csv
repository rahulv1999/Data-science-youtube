jitendra kundu,"Respected sir I hv one doubt.

In the lecture u stated a example of bus driver citing the involvement of all the employees in a hole. Driver has take care of neat and cleanness of bus along with driving.
But my question is about remuneration.. Driver will say I am driver and I am getting payment of driving. In a organisation also a worker will say I am worker and getting salary of a worker. Why should I take care of the duty and responsibility of a manager partly in the name of TQM? Company will not give me manager's salary. After all I am working here for money. It is his duty let him to do. 

How a manager could enforce or motivate a person for doing so as he is right in his words. Perhaps you agree with me.

MD.ZEESHAN MOHNAVI,"I am preparing for GATE 2019, and I have watched the first 10 lectures of this playlist until the time of writing this. This, by far, is one of the worst lecture series I have seen from NPTEL. No doubt, the professor is from one of the best technical institutions in India, but below are the demerits I observed.
 - The professor is just reading out the slides with no emphasis on explaining the slides.
 - The explanations are too vague and are done by means of ""hand gestures"" only.
 - A lot of technical jargon is used without a complete explanation. Every time the professor says - ""We will see it later"". This is not OK! If some terms are introduced as part an explanation then at least some explanation should be provided for those terms here.
