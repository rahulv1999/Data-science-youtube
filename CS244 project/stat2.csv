Sonja Nguyen,"I both agree and disagree with Crosby. Yeah, humans are terribly destroying the environment and half of us don't even really care for the impoverished. However is that due to the Columbian Exchange? No that's just us as humans. However I can't be so pessimistic. I also can't imagine history any other way. If we didn't have something so significant in history, we'd be a worse world for it. Everything we have now is because of the Columbian Exchange. Not just all the bad things but the good things too.  Better education, more feminism, and ways to support our Earth. So while I do believe in what Crosby says, I still think we need  the Columbian Exchange in our history. Also, as for how this affects how I live, I think it will make me more compassionate and open-minded because your question made me think on both sides of the story while seeing the horrors the Columbian Exchange has caused makes me very humbled.

Tyler Newman,"So, about pigs...

Yeah, they definitely breed a lot, but as pointed out (somewhere) in Jared Diamond's popular Guns, Germs, and Steel, pigs are filthy.  They eat anything, and for whatever reason their diseases seem to adapt well to us (i think same reason we can use their insulin, if I understand pig bio - which, i probably don't).   But, among other things, de Soto was not great at keeping all his pigs together (hence the wild hog population throughout much of de Soto's trail).  All these pigs carried these Euro disease (and a bio-stew of other pathogens) throughout the new world.

And horses,
While, yes, horses came with the Spanish in the 16th century, they had similar problems keeping their herd together.  They also used natives as horse-slaves (the ones who weren't otherwise enslaved).  Natives didn't passively submit to their devastation; many would migrate away from Spanish presence and bring the horses with them.  By the time Anglo-French-American settlers began pushing out, several robust cultures began to take shape around the horse.  The Lakota were master horsemen before they ever met a European. 

Unfortunately, the same resistance and inter-relations among Native groups also spread those diseases.  But, it's important to remember that European incursion happened over the course of 400ish years.  In that 400 years, Native cultures shifted, adapted, and resisted.  A lot of discussion seem to box that 400 years into ""contact, contagion, conquer,"" focusing on the European impact.  But, most Native peoples were eventually subjugated by a mature and established U.S.A, not some colonial, European proxy.",UgzFvEOh3NFo1cetdWh4AaABAg,none,1,2019-06-29T08:59:23.000Z,8,HQPA5oNpfM4,0.6397

Ban,"Isn't the question of whether or not the Columbian exchange was a good thing, an irrelevant one? If an encounter between two vastly different cultures is inevitable, I think there's no point on getting hung up on the merits of the exchange. Debating the merits is like acknowledging that a debate should exist on whether or not they should have explored the America's. But it was an inevitable event, so the subsequent tragedy and exchange of ideas was also inevitable. So who cares about the positive or negative impact. I think a more more interesting thing to discuss is the manner that the European powers colonized the America's and the lasting legacy that those imperial powers left behind.

This is the coming Intelligence Explosion. This would never happen with no Computing Revolution. Which wouldn't have happened without an Industrial Revolution.

Kitten Hermit,"Tbh I think the Columbian exchange was not only necessary, it was inevitable and the earlier it happened the better it really was for humans and our biosphere. Had Columbus not discovered the New World, someone else would have (I know he wasn't actually the first to discover it but he was the  reason the Europeans came over), and they would most likely have come with even worse diseases and possibly have been in a much more brutal mood as they were dying due to lack of food and would've killed a lot more simply to get crops. I think generally when you look at History sometimes the most negative events result in the most positive changes hundreds of years later so its hard to say what would have been the best course for humanity as a whole, especially when the average human consumes something from the New World pretty much every day.",UgiZjIT-CAYQ-HgCoAEC,none,0,2017-07-02T10:20:20.000Z,10,HQPA5oNpfM4,-0.8899

Gloria Li,"Do you agree with Crosby? Are longer, healthier lives for more humans worth the sacrifice of an impoverished biosphere? And most importantly, how will your conclusions about those questions shape the way that you live your life?

I disagree with Crosby for obviously bias reasons such as I am human and I want to live longer which I will try to justify. I don't think extending human lives means sacrificing the biosphere. I think the question is what are we doing about the environment even though we have extended lives. I think the extension of our age is natural in evolution of the human species. The increase in food, medicine and resources extended our life expectancy. The problem is not that we have better resources suited towards us instead of to the rest of the biosphere. The problem is that people do not care enough to take basic actions at home in order to slow down the depreciation of the biosphere. For example, politicians control the climate of our government that regulates things such as CO2 emissions. Perhaps if people committed to the Paris Climate Change agreement instead of letting their greed take over then maybe it will still slow down the depreciation of the biosphere. No matter what I think the biosphere will constantly be changing and species will evolve or die out. It's a matter of how quickly. 

In addition, regular people at home in developed countries consuming more than most people in developing countries should learn to use less and waste less. I disagree with Crosby because that would mean if the Columbian Exchange didn't happen then a lot of innovation and technology that can solve our current problems wouldn't exist. In conclusion, I think we are fighting against our own greed as a society instead of the battle between humans and other species.",UgiFijCmf1VAHngCoAEC,none,0,2017-06-19T11:28:38.000Z,11,HQPA5oNpfM4,-0.8595

If humans live longer and are the better for it, so be it, since human life is incomparably more valuable than that of a microscopic organism.",UggA3IX1wuNeR3gCoAEC,none,0,2016-07-06T16:39:42.000Z,16,HQPA5oNpfM4,-0.1879

Matrinique,"I THINK it's impossible that the Columbian exchange wouldn't happen at some point. I think it's impossible that globalization won't happen either, and that we won't become less diverse in the future. You can already see it happening, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Although Mr. Smith might've been right when he said humanity is a virus. These were phases humans had to go through. We've learned a lot since then, haven't we? That's why we can retrospectively look back and have this discussion today.

But I also think we have very short memories, and in spite of all efforts to remember and learn from history, we're bound to forget. It's in the genes. I cannot see whether maturity as a species is at all possible. How easy it is to brainwash a whole generation and build a different age from that. The brainwashing is going on, even now... 

How should society change in order to cultivate informed people who will be responsible for themselves, each other, and the planet? Do you think humanity has an ultimate form? And if it does, will we live long enough to reach it before destroying ourselves?

Or don't you think we like our wars and our struggles, and if we didn't have them, then what value is there to even living?

Everyone seems to have their own idea of an ideal world, whether that world is the bubble they live in, or the whole planet. Everyone's striving for something. There's no such thing as good or bad, so how do you know who's right, what's better, what should be done? And if we even work for that cause, who's to say it's doing more good than harm?

Gahhh I hate the questions your questions make me remember! I have enough trouble figuring out what to do with myself, let alone the rest of the world. I don't actually really wanna deal with this. Sometimes the weight of it all crushes me and I feel so helpless. I mean, does it even really matter what I do with myself in the grand scheme of things? Everyone should just hold hands and walk to oblivion together. That's simpler and cleaner.",Uggq6ph0cu5kpngCoAEC,none,0,2016-06-12T03:06:59.000Z,3,HQPA5oNpfM4,-0.9719

Andrea Payne,BAHHHHH grapes are native to the Americas too.  In fact the modern vineyard has both European and American vines growing in them.  the bottom half of the grape vine is American but the top (the part that actually produces the grapes) is European for the most part.  Even in Europe this holds true.  You can thank an American pest that nearly destroyed the European vineyard industry for that.  The American species is resistant to this pest whereas the European species is highly susceptible.   By grafting  the American root to the European fruit producing section you get a resistant plant!

Supadubya,"Crosby's a moron.  ""Not a richer, but a more impoverished genetic pool"".  Seriously, WHERE DOES HE GET THIS STUFF?  He clearly doesn't understand biology or genetics, at all.  The knitting together of previously isolated human populations allowed for gene flow between them (through migration, intermarriage, and reproduction), essentially creating one larger genetic pool.  And, speaking as a trained biologist, it is an unequivocal and well-known fact by any expert in the field that having a larger population leads to higher genetic variability due to reduced loss of traits due to genetic drift.  That is, one large, interconnected population can support far more genetic variability (both for good, as with beneficial traits, and for ill, as with recessive genetic diseases) than a set of smaller, isolated populations with the same total membership (and the Columbian Exchange also led to long-term increases in population size- after a bottleneck that lasted too few generations to significantly reduce genetic variability...)  In short, it is a KNOWN FACT that the Columbian Exchange enriched the genetic pool, and anybody who says otherwise in the matter of Crosby is speaking out of ignorance of a field (genetics) that they have no real understanding of...",UgjjImXPeLXq1ngCoAEC,none,0,2015-09-03T08:11:06.000Z,8,HQPA5oNpfM4,-0.5978

Austin Myers,"A bit of a tedious correction, but Nietzsche probably didn't die of syphilis, and it's my understanding that he actually died of a cancerous tumor in his brain. The syphilis story was spread as part of an anti-Nazi smear campaign. This is made even more tedious by the fact that most scholarly interpretations of Nietzsche read his philosophy and himself personally as decidedly anti-Nazi himself, albeit at least a little bit racist. Apparently, in his time, he was understood by many as such, largely due to misunderstanding and perhaps just purposeful removal from context to manipulate his words. 

I recently took a class on Nietzsche in which our professor broke down this mind-boggling and unfortunately catchy lie. In fewer words, some anti-Nazis invented this syphilis story to smear someone who was actually not pro-Nazi at all.

Team of (no longer pseudo?) historians, does this check out?

Jessica Manuel,"I'm in love with the Colonial Era and the age of discovering new lands however the heavy tragedy of it all is that it was the beginning of a new age of corruption. Many of the Spanish Conquistadors mainly wanted to conquer lands due their quest for gold - as well as wanting to change the pagan beliefs they encountered in turn for Catholicism. Thus it is hard to determine whether it was a great thing such expeditions were made as it started of civil wars and slavery. However without it happening, there would have been no America today - and if we were to still live in the Old World ideology then we would be living our lives in a thoughtless bubble.

The poverty and/or instability of African nations, tensions in the Middle East by overthrowing governments, installing tyrants, and redrawing borders, the desecration of history (e.g shooting at the sphinx), and the enslavement, slaughter, and marginalization of peoples from the Americans to the Aboriginals. I'm not even going to begin to talk about the ecological impacts unless you want an entire dissertation.

Colin W,"In response the quote from Alfred Crosby Jr. at 0:22-0:28, the best selling authors of Freakonomics remind us that thinking big is not always the best method. Here's an exert to justify their reasoning:
Small questions are by their nature less often asked and investigated, and maybe not at all. They are virgin territory for true learning.
2.Since big problems are usually a dense mass of intertwined small problems, you can make more progress by tackling a small piece of the big problem than by flailing away at grand solutions.
3.Any kind of change is hard, but the chances of triggering change on a small problem are much greater than on a big one.
4.Thinking big is, by definition, an exercise in imprecision or even speculation. When you think small, the stakes may be diminished but at least you can be relatively sure you know what youre talking about.

So this all sounds great in theory, but does it really work?

ismelljello,"Could you imagine what the New World would look like today if old world disease had not been a factor during the Colombian exchange? You'd have preserved armies at full strength spanning across the American continents, ready to defend their respective empires.

The sheer numbers, preserved organization and acquirement of Old World ideas and technology (and potential improvement) would have been a sort of steroid for the indigenous national consciousness,

These nuances would have most likely jettisoned Native peoples to the forefront of the world stage. Their endless resources and newly acquired social/technological advancements would have made their endless and inevitably unified numbers into a world power house.

Imagine the brown man defending his coastal borders all along the Atlantic with the very muskets his people traded for or learned to make.The numbers of these newly evolved peoples would be far too much any one European country to even think of confronting.

Should the benefits of the Old World have reached a people who's population hadn't been decimated, you'd be right to imagine no truer rival for the Europeans than the Natives.

Even after the Native holocaust, it still took American settlers until 1890 to get these road warrior like stragglers who's ancestors evaded disease to admit defeat.

Rahsaan Footman,"The question this Crash Course lays is essentially a hollow one. First, Mr. Cosby goes back and forth between summation (all the damage total) and the momentary (what damage is done at a given point of time ) Take an argument about Old World diseases killing so many natives. A counter argument is that 100% of those people and Europeans that visited their lands are dead. Another way to see this is that at the time extinctions of certain plants and animals is a bad thing. But at the time finding and growing enough to eat at the time is a good thing. Slaughtering buffalo may seem bad, but cutting down the competition for grazing cattle to feed a city, nation, world is seen as a good.

The reason I call it a hollow question is because there is no way to hold accountability. The most we can do is decide whether to identify with those ancestors who do things we'd disagree with. I can't say I make a choice based on how someone years, decades or centuries in the future will judge it.

I am trying to find out more about what was happening outside of my sphere of the world without prejudice and hope that when writing these in the future, there is more of an attempt in the broad scope of the videos to capture an unbiased view of these points.

On a more video focussed note, in my view the Colombian exchange is one of the worst things to happen to the planet, up there with pretty big meteor strikes. Decreasing biodiversity and the eventual explosion of the Human population, with all the subsequent resource mining and pollution which we brought with us, we are still living in the legacy of this event hundreds of years from its happening and will be for the foreseeabel future.

One of the things I liked about the videos so far was that it refused to ignore China, Africa, Islam, the East Indies, etc. I am now 28, and most of my world history lessons revolved around Europe. Still, I am a bit disappointed that the Native Americans (both North and South) have not been mentioned until now. Browsing through the next few videos, it does not seem like the Incans, Mayans, etc will get the same treatment that the Egyptians, Greeks and Mongols did, even though their Empires, culture, and intellect still impact the world today.

This was one reason they switched to African slaves. Africans did have livestock, and therefore had been exposed to smallpox before so most of the population was resistant to it.

Cormac O Sullivan,"I generally love this series. However, the stereotypical depiction of Irish people as drunks around 09:00 is hurtful. This is especially offensive ( not to mention historically reductive ) in the context of its inclusion in relation to the famine, which killed 1 million people and was the result of a complex series of British laws designed to impoverish the native Irish, which had nothing to do with alcohol abuse. Please remove the offensive graphic but keep up the otherwise amazing work.

With a kiss from a Swiss

Had been given it free
By a sweet little cheat in Paree.

Then a Moor from Iran,

How the whole thing began;

Olivier L'Italien,"But the renaissance was more than an artistic revolution. You guys said it yourself in the beginning of the video. So why attribute the renaissance to the money... that then paid for the arts? Ive always been taught that the renaissance was attributed to the rediscovery of the Greek philosophies. One revolutionary thought in particular was the idea that knowledge is within us all (See Meno from Plato). This meant that, if well trained, even a peasant could make valuable discoveries. Christians liked this idea too, translating it into We are in the image of God. His knowledge is within us. We are creators, like God. Maybe for this renaissance was just a vintage art trend in the eyes of the Aristocrats, but what about the thinkers (See Cusa, Kepler, Leibniz).",UgzYdSaYKqL9NMsbYWh4AaABAg,none,0,2020-03-24T23:33:37.000Z,23,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9587

So many great building such as the Church of Santa Maria del fiore and many more where created because of families such as the Medici through civil humanism.

agnostic gnostic,"This whole renaissance 're-discovery' thing, sounds very dodgy.  Everything else seems to be in tiny fragments of ruins, except the greek and roman stuff has been immaculated preserved for millennia.  And, its much wierder than lots of other 'paganism'.  Wierder usually equates to more modern.   

Its also kin of contrary to the colonising crusades, inquisitions, witchunts and 'reformations' of the seemingly relatively-believable stories of humanity's recent past.  It seems we can see when these factions were seperate and at odds, and the not-so-holy not-even-roman empire maps show this visually and clearly.

Maybe 'antiquity' was never completely lost and re-discovered and isn't so ancient after all?

Just as all but the deeply sinister and O-cult Oxford and Cambridge uni-verse-cities now admit, that the 'new' world was not discovered for the first time by Columbus and co, that the 'new' world was just temporarily out of touch with the 'old' world.

Maybe the old world was reformed by the secular-science priest class, by the likes of Newton, Rousseau, Voltaire and others, the progress of which may have been to the approval of the (holy roman) empire and its med-evil book-burning, his-story re-writing, mythology-rewriting and child-molesting priest class.  Go back further, if we could, and we might see how the bourgeoisie leapt into their abstract explorations and left 'paganism' behind.

What kind of spoken, or unspoken, deal went on whereby the humanists kind of have free mental-reign as the empire of terror devoured the flesh and spirit of the people from all other 'angles'?

""Now that we've conquered you, bourgois pontificators,"" said the Habsburg emperor to the finally-acquired elasticated-puppet-string pretend republics of England, France and Rome ""you can have your abstract waffle, your greek freak geek stuff, your hell-en-ism, middle caste trinkets, Aragon superiority arrogance and comfort in the money pyramid social status.  Butt question the bankhers, question the authority of govern-ment, and we'll give you a stake in that (snigger), question your own silly sciences or question our his story, especially egypt, and you'll go the way of the Incas.  Give unto Wofsheyeld what is due unto Wofscheyeld.  Blame the Romans.  Helen was millennia ago, Egypt was milennia ago.  Capiche""

""Yes Osiris, err, Sire""

""That's better, and make that Horus a silent 'H' while you're at it, the crew-see-fiction when they sing a c-horus.  Delete it in future dictionnaries if the fish-kids aren't schooled to forget.  And ban sex-talk, we don't want them noticing the resurrection uis a spelling of the re-erection now do we?""

""Got it.  You can have your age-of-weason abswact science, no more roman, celtic, helen-istic, babylonian or egyptian.  Stick with the mary story fairy story if the ask about 'notre dame de Paris'!""

Maybe it went down this way, maybe it didn't and the abswact age-of-reason bourgeoisie are just a bunch of spelled dumb-asses lost in abstract thinking.  Half the bosses I ever worked for, and my own parents fit the latter description.  The others kinda felt like they couldn't avoid the abstract nonsense they had to speak to their peers.

They'd have made a right mess on their own, but certainly nothing like the evil mess we see.

We know full well that the secret deals of the secrative sea-creatures and their secretaries, they happen, and they don't get posted, or made available from locked files, or written in the first place, except for the occassional leak.",UgzQRsqb-inJCcSp-hJ4AaABAg,none,0,2020-02-15T02:33:26.000Z,2,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.4896

Karel Dole?el,"If youre here to learn about Renaissance, dont even bother. (Theres a brief overview between 1:08 and 3:11, but thats basically it.) I dont know what I expected, but this video is nothing but political agenda and sophism. Instead of actually talking about what Renaissance was, 80% of the video is devoted to who should be given credit for it. (Or whether it even happened?) And the presented arguments are downright absurd.

""Renaissance was funded by the trade with the Ottoman Empire?"" Trading means an exchange of goods and services, not philanthropy. The money (and alum), that was brouht back to Italy, was exchanged for the Venetian textiles and Milanian weapons that you mentioned and wasnt therefore owed to anyone. Venice and Milan werent rich because of some ""Ottoman benevolence"", but because of their labor and ingenuity to produce high quality products. They got rich on their own merits.
And even if it was, even if Leonardo da Vincis patrons werent the Medici but some rich Ottoman family, his works are still credited to him alone. Renaissance is defined by the arts and intellectualism, not the money. A lot of people in a lots of places had gold, but only one place had the artists to produce Renaissance art. 
You might as well talk about how Chinese culture should be credited to Europeans, because ""the Chinese got rich by trading on the Silk Road"". It would be an equally absurd argument.

""The Muslim world was the source of many of the writings Renaissance scholars studied?"" So lets give them credit for their own inventions and contributions? How is it relevant to Renaissance? The Sumerians invented the Cuneiform writing, should we give them credit for Romeo and Juliet? Should the Ottoman culture itself be credited to the Greek authors they studied? Everyone was influenced by someone.
In fact, if were gonna go down that road, doesent the fact that we are talking about Greek authors make it a pretty much pointless discussion? What exactly is the ""added value"" here? Preserving of knowledge? Transcribing? That doesent make it a ""source of the writings the Renaissance scholars studied"". The ""source"" were the Greek authors who wrote them.
 
""Renaissance didnt happen because most people didnt know about it?"" I dont even know what was the crazy idea behind that one. The buildings, sculptures and literature defining Renaissance exist, which in fact proves its existence. History isnt a popularity contest. 
Was Europe enlightened? Yes, it was. Although I never heard anyone claim that the entire European population, presumably including newborn babies, was engulfed by humanism. Thats just a crazy straw man.  But Im pretty sure more people saw a Ranaissance building than the Battle of Hastings.
And when Johaness Guttenberg invented the printing press in 1440, a lot of Renaissance literature got in the hands of ordinary people shortly thereafter. (But I guess that didnt make the cut.)",UgyIL1Pj0X2yRs1Xudd4AaABAg,none,0,2019-12-12T22:12:52.000Z,22,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9944

Out Of Oblivion Productions,Aristotle was right about ethics. Copernicus was influenced by a Greek astronomer who believed the universe heliocentric.

Painting certain biblical figures over and over again doesn't necessarily mean the artists were doing so out of devotion to Catholicism; they were most often commissioned, downright forced, or trying to appeal to nobles in order to earn more for their efforts. Artists then weren't celebrated like they are today, and those who chose this path were considered failures (at least until they were taken under a great mentor's wing and had produced some renowned pieces). In families with a certain kind of history they were expected to carry on with their legacy, which with high regard included professions such as becoming a blacksmith or banker.

Steve Wilson,I think John tries to make the point which could have been more forcefully is that the renaissance is a sort of an outdated eurocentric way to teach the history of this era in time. Instead of learning the crusade->renaissance timeline that I'm sure we all grew up with.  A more accurate picture would be to teach of the Muslim world's active influence on European learning the way they teach that the Greeks influenced Rome centuries before.  It was the Islam Golden age which had gone on for a while before this time that actually kept the Greek/Roman body of knowledge alive and diffused it to Europe.,UgyTmXJpqzP-0wYZU8N4AaABAg,none,3,2019-09-01T15:14:59.000Z,15,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.765

Frederick Torres,"The Islamic Golden Age was entirely fueled through the study of ancient Greek texts, with incremental improvements, vastly built upon in Europe during the Renaissance. The Islamic world was already on a downward slope intellectually by the 11th Century due to the influence of Al Ghazali and his opinion of heretical pagan Greek texts. These same texts which are the heart and soul of any of these sciences and had largely been lost to Europe until the Renaissance. Such as Plato, largely reduced to a fragmentary text of Timaeus for a thousand years in the Latin world. Before we get carried away with crediting Islam with the success of Europe, it's its important to remember where their own success was indebted, and to keep account of who exactly it was that paved the way to splitting the atom and going to the moon. So yes, the Renaissance was definitely a thing, with the proliferation of translations made available through the Medici and Marsilio Ficino and the development of the Gutenberg Press magnifying the already immense libraries developing across Europe and ensuring the preservation of classical literature definitively forever.",UgwCQ8Me7pDmFVWhY3d4AaABAg,none,0,2019-07-15T13:14:52.000Z,13,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9612

Then a guy called Aldus Manutius in Italy started printing a ton of books about his favourite things, such as the Greeks, and his press is one of the reasons that Europe suddenly started learning about and nerding out over the Greeks. He even invented a new, slanted font to try and pack more letters onto a page. Because he was in in Italy, it got called italics. In any case, the sudden increase in the availability of books (from Aldus and various others) was critical in spreading ideas, such as Copernicus's heliocentric model of the solar system.",UgwBFzb95LhoyPvFXeV4AaABAg,none,0,2019-05-22T06:53:32.000Z,6,Vufba_ZcoR0,0

The fact is that something is infact hapening regardless of their awareness and the renaissance is just the name we gave what happened. Like with anything that hapened in history for example as you bring up the battle of hastings, i would assume people weren't standing there before the battle calling it ""THE battle of hastings"" they probebly just called it another battle, they knew where it was, and after it played out people named the battle so that it could be remembered.",Ugy4ikSdAqIr0IY8EU14AaABAg,none,41,2019-04-04T07:24:02.000Z,7,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.8717

Mark Langridge,"Lots of people taking this out of context. He's arguing (he says arguing, not definitely proving) that Renaissance ""wasn't a thing"" because we teach it as if it was a singular event that took place over a short timespan, such as the French Revolution, or World War II, or widespread adoption of the internet (this is far more profound than you may realize.)

The Renaissance didn't occur like this points in time, these historical events. It was more of a time period than a historical event. That's all he's saying, and it can't really be argued. John *clearly states* that he isn't suggesting the events of the Renaissance never happened. Think about it, though. Most of the famous figures of the Renaissance didn't even know each other.

And yes, just because very few people actually experienced the Renaissance as it was happening, doesn't mean it isn't important. However, John never claimed that, never even hinted at it. The Renaissance was enormously important to history, especially art history.

It's much like how the post impressionist painters were not a cohesive movement. In fact, post impressionism was only named as such after the ""movement"" had ended and the artists had died.",UgzU8so_WeEGY_lH7xR4AaABAg,none,0,2018-10-23T18:38:40.000Z,18,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.6543

Zebedee Hill,"I have to disagree with you on the argument that the renaissance didn't happen. You're looking at one point of the renaissance, also bring the most popular, in the arts. You consistently talk about how the arts only affected the upper class, which it did, but neglect to talk about the effect that it had. That art brought the idea of being human. That humans weren't put on earth to do God's bidding, instead you could aspire to be something, instead of scholars arguing about how many angels can sit on a pinhead, they asked questioned about why humans where, well, humans. What made a human, why a human made certain moral decisions. If we take your example of how long the renaissance lasted - 1400s to 1600s - then it would include the reformation, where people asked the moral decisions of the church. You witnessed history by seeing people dismantle and climb the Berlin wall, well these people witnessed the divide of a religion, and I think that is relatively important to history.",Ugzyur92aLJM-vZIogV4AaABAg,none,0,2018-09-03T01:59:13.000Z,1,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.3079

Peter Kauffner,"Yes, the peasant behind the plow might not have seen a difference between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. But every major intellectual of the period remarks on the fact that he lived in a new age of possibilities that is distinct from what went before. The big change was that it was OK to be happy and enjoy being alive. Medieval writers were severely depressed by modern standards and saw worldly life simply as a preparation for the afterworld. Many people assume that it was classical science that was ""reborn"" in the Renaissance. But the reception of classical science happened in the twelfth century during the High Middle Ages.  What the Renaissance learned from classical writers was humanism and an appreciation of art.",Ugw5FQQfUbEsUrALtdx4AaABAg,none,0,2018-06-06T04:53:27.000Z,4,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9656

billhammerjr,"The idea that there was not a Renaissance is provocative but it does not help in the understanding of the ideas that were expressed in that time time and place.  Many of which are noted in these threads.  There was no mention of the European renaissance which picked up these ideas and spread it across Europe in which were the antecedents of the Reformation and the Enlightenment can be traced.  I think the 1% that were in the renaissance realized their was something happening they were a part of.  It's hard to imagine Lorenzo Valla was not writing to the 1%.  Something else to consider is what was the capacity of the people to absorb the Renaissance.  In a medieval Europe what percentage could read with the Church largely controlling education.  And the growth of a middle class craft class . . . I don't think dismissing the era over it's length in time is helpful to understanding the period or the transmission of it's memes.

A simple comparison is the 60s.  Were people walking around in 1969 USA saying ""Hey it's the decade of the 60s?  I don't think so.  But they thought they were living through an exceptional era.  And for better or worse we refer to the era as the 60's.",UgykjIh_2iMcELlQ1nV4AaABAg,none,0,2018-05-13T12:54:20.000Z,12,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.1313

Annabel Noordzij,"One thing that is majorly misunderstood is that the Renaissance did not introduce the 'lost' Greek knowledge. Texts on Aristotle and other Greek writers had already been re-introduced in Europe starting in the 11th century. Next to that, it wasn't purely Greek knowledge, but a combination of ancient Greek and medieval Arabic knowledge. People like to say that the Renaissance was a scientific revolution, but it was merely a continuation of the scientific climate which had persisted in the universities for centuries. The biggest change was that science became more secularized, as in it was no longer exclusive to the clergy to study science, not that those scientist became less Christian. The Renaissance can best be described as a cultural movement, since there's clear evidence of changes in the artistic and literary spheres, but not as a standalone scientific movement, nor the start of any huge social changes.",UgxbxrWLNJATt0PZiZZ4AaABAg,none,0,2018-04-26T11:00:40.000Z,11,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9132

Juci Shockwave,"I would argue that the Renaissance people were even more religious than they were during medieval times. Also more superstitious which can be seen through the publications of religious textbooks and interpretations and well as the rise of witch hunts. Medieval people didn't believe in witches and thought of them as superstitions. The Renaissance brought about the ideas that women were inherently easy to be manipulated by the devil thus the idea that women must submit to men and thus years of oppression and control under ""patriarchal"" ruing for next 4 1/2 centuries of sheer oppression for women. Great case in point, during Medieval times women were allowed to hold and own their own businesses and property, as well as divorce laws that would make modern laws seem like a park in the park. Did you know that women could divorce their husbands if they have bad breath. O_O The Renaissance basically took all of the rights women had and basically made them legal slaves to their husbands and families until mid 1900s and even some Providences /states in the Americas and certain European nations didn't allow women property and divorce rights until 1980s.

dyn01234567,"It seems to me the John is treating the renaissance like and event by comparing it to the fall of the Berlin wall. The Renaissance was an era, not an event and in that sense it did happen.

It's true that the average person didn't see it's effects, but that can be said of many eras as they happened. The medieval era didn't effect the average person all that much either, because very few people lived in a castle, was a knight or had any impact on the feudal social structure. But castles still got built, knights existed and the feudal system ruled the land. They're the things we remember because they left a a greater mark on the landscape and influenced our systems of governance more than a guy growing turnips in a field.",UgytpgToTiISPfuTaah4AaABAg,none,0,2017-12-07T03:09:42.000Z,3,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.5499

Johnny Luken,"1. The Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire existed unbroken for almost 3,000 years from the time of the Renaissance, extending back to the time of the Ancient Greeks. Most of the works of the Ancient Greeks, along with people with the ability to interpret them, existed there for the duration.

2. Christian scholars existed throughout Europe even in the depths of the Dark Ages (beautiful handcrafted Latin scriptures exist in Ireland dating as far back as AD 500), as Christianity had been able to rapidly spread across Europe even as the Western Roman Empire faltered.

3. GraecoRoman artifacts still physically existed and could be found throughout the territories of the former Roman Empire up to time of the Renaissance.

4. Large, stable and prosperous kingdoms had started to naturally coalesce in Europe from AD 800-1200, mapping quite closely to modern European nations from this point

5. When the Renaissance occurred in Europe, there was no Muslim correlate

Amanda C.,"Just because the Renaissance artists created works of art depicting religious figures doesn't imply that they themselves were religious. At the time, artists had a clientele consisting mostly of the Pope and the clergy in general, because they were obviously quite wealthy compared to common people, so religious depictions was kinda their thing and they had very specific requests. The Catholic Churh saw art as a way of displaying wealth and power, so this was quite a benefit for the artists. However, many artists, including da Vinci, created (not only) religious works of art, but sometimes tried to incorporate their own (non-religious) ideas, via symbolism, which the clergy didn't fancy much and had not so pleasant results.",UgymlhU019zMQE5T1gd4AaABAg,none,0,2017-10-27T11:29:12.000Z,11,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.1376

Tim Petzold,"A couple of things. The video makes an effort of painting the Renaissance as a result of Arabic influence on Europe. There is certainly a good deal of intellectual benefit that Europe received from the Islamic world. But the reception of thinkers like Aristotle and Avicenna happened in the 13th century, the time of the scholastic tradition more so than the humanist. Btw, Aristotle had been studied well before that, as his logical works were the focus of study throughout the Middle Ages, thanks to Boethius and Porphyry. The 12th century saw the gain of his whole corpus. But it was the re-discovery of Plato and other writers of Greco-Roman culture like Cicero and Livy that spurred the thought of the Renaissance. And that brings me to another note, there is a different way that the Islamic world is credited with igniting the Renaissance. The Ottoman sacking of the Byzantine world and the fall of Constantinople caused their thinkers to flee to Latin Europe bringing their texts with them. It's easy to see why something this politically incorrect did not get mentioned though.",Ugzw3RSbrPBgX6AmRFt4AaABAg,none,1,2017-08-28T21:28:00.000Z,21,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9842

Twisted Pixel,"saying the Renaissance wasn't really a thing because of the length it lasted (~200) is like saying the classical age(~800), or the bronze age (~1100, or ~500, ~300, ~300 depending on how you look at it) wasn't really a thing either.  I think you're just missing the fact that the ""ages"" are simply summaries of a time, before something amazing changed everything. I mean, i guess maybe you're arguing about all the incredible developments discovered in this time should each be their own defining categories, which is a fair argument, but think of what that would do to the industrial age, or frankly, any age after.  humans are compounding at an exponential rate, thanks to, a large part, the Renaissance.  The relative peace and prosperity that followed the middle ages is what ushered in this age, and the difference of such, has ushered in every age before it.  The ultimate point i'm trying to make (of which i recognise you touched on, but i don't feel you gave it enough credit) Is that ages are not defined by their accomplishments, but in their stabilities.",Ugj6aRTqearuYngCoAEC,none,0,2017-07-08T11:15:46.000Z,11,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9253

Benjamin Dixon,"While I can appreciate your point regarding the rennaissance not being an actual thing I have to disagree. While it didnt enlighted the world as a whole, or even europe, it led to the reintroduction of widespread republicanism and the study of the humanities. For example, Thomas Jefferson and many of the founding fathers of America - as well as the not so successfull French revolution - were proufoundly influenced by the Renaissance/enlightenment. It wasn't a singular moment that profoundly changed history, but I have to argue that it was a series of events which had a tremendous impact on the future of European peoples and nations. To appease younger me, ill quote Jellow Biafra from the song ""Chickenshit conformist"" on the Dead Kennedys ""Bedtime for Democracy"" album : ""Any real change takes more time and effort than changing channels on the TV set.""

Scott Butler,"None of his points successfully refute the existence of the Renaissance. The rise in humanism, even if only in a small segment of the population, still led to changes in political and religious thought that ultimately gave us the Age of Discovery, which via Western Imperialism gave us globalization, and the Enlightenment, which in turn gave us modern democracy and secularism. Whether you think those are good or bad points does not lower their importance. The Renaissance wasnt a single point that immediately changed everything for everyone and it never claims to be that. It was a revolution in thought and culture that led ultimately to discoveries in science, of continents, of changes in human expression, and even was part of a chain of trends that led to a complete transformation of global society.",UghJ-4fPY305QXgCoAEC,none,0,2017-02-25T20:58:41.000Z,20,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.3352

aurelius,"An Open Letter to Mr. Green & Co.

Dear Mr. Green and Company,

I love this series. I love Crash Course. I platonically love you all.

But this episode, though. I don't care for it.

See, the Renaissance existed as much as any other period of history exists: in our minds, as a handy reference tool. If the Inquisition exists, so too does the Renaissance. If the Golden Age of Islam exists, so too does the Renaissance. If the Silk Road exists, so too does the Renaissance.

You describe the Renaissance, near the end of the video, as ""a lot of mutually interdependent things that occurred over centuries."" Yes - which is to say, it's a thing. It's a thing that helps historians group similar ideas over a period of time. Saying the Renaissance didn't exist is like saying Ancient China (for instance) didn't exist because it, too, is a lot of mutually interdependent things that occurred over centuries.""

Eurocentrism sucks, but that doesn't mean everything European that was positive should be minimalized. If you're going to - rightfully! - denounce European violence, so too must you not minimalize Middle Eastern violence or Asian violence. (For example: The Mongol Conquests killed at *least* 40,000,000 people - possibly more like 70,000,000! - but the Mongols get endless praise and a comical throwback in every episode.)

I still do love this series. And Crash Course. And, platonically, you.

Best wishes,
Me",UggQZ3bP4F1l93gCoAEC,none,192,2017-02-01T23:43:01.000Z,23,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.6706

Emily H,"your right that the term ""renaissance"" is a label that we, in the present, give to a set period of time in history (from the THIRTEENTH century to the 16th) but that doesn't mean it isn't a valid concept. 
Its just an umbrella- term for; a popular style of thinking, fashion sense, series of events, works of art and much more that existed/happened during said given period of time. 
When someone says the word ""renaissance"" you automatically (to a good degree subconsciously) get a general idea of all these things in your head. Language is such a limited means of communication and expression, (and the human mind itself is pretty finite) we need to make it as easy as possible to (albeit) roughly refer to things, such as slices of time in history.

Only the ill-informed would say that the Renaissance was an ""instant-on"" era where suddenly Europe becomes magically reinterested in the classical world. Once you study it you realize that ""renaissance"" thinkers were spread apart geographically and chronologically, but that is much the same as the classical world (in fact, much further spread apart chronologically than many renaissance thinkers).

Renaissance was an ""Age"". Ages never have set dates for starting or ending. The Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages don't have set dates. The Industrial Revolution does not have a set date. But, they all happened and were important.

The term ""Renaissance"", as far as I know, was coind by Jules Michelet, yet, what was supposed to be reborn had already been happening.

Bill McHale,"Linking Aristotle to ""The Renaissance"" is a bit a historical.  His writings were recovered in the late 12th and earlth 13th centuries and played a central role in Scholasticism, especially the thinking of Thomas Aquinas.   Now, if we want to talk about Plato's writings, you have a stronger case.  Its also true that Plato's writings seemed to have a strong influence on Copernicus, Galileo and others.  

The strongest case against the Renaissance as a distinct break from the past, is that for that idea to work, you need to paint the high and late medieval period (which the Renaissance overlaps with) as being eras of ignorance (i.e., the long outdated view of them as ""the Dark Ages"".).  In reality, it was a period when Universities were founded, achievements were being made in engineering, farming, philosophy, etc. (Don't believe me?  The Roman's wouldn't have been able to build a Gothic Cathedral... even with concrete).",UgiqLJz43OUVaHgCoAEC,none,18,2016-04-21T20:07:16.000Z,20,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.8957

megan brown,"I didn't entirely agree with one point you made. You said that that the proof that the writers and scholars were secretly not religious was the Art they painted. However I don't think that is substantial proof because of how big the religious power was at the time. Religious authorities, including the pope had the money and were prepared to pay a lot for religious Art. Paint was expensive and as a Artist like Leonardo or Michael Angelo you could guarantee a lot of money for a religious commission. Any other subjects and they probably would have died poor people who we would not have heard of today. I'm not an Historian, so there may be other evidence however a big point that is hard to miss is the fact that despite the rise in Humanism and Secularism, denying your faith in Religion at that time would have still meant a death sentence. Even Martin Luther who never denied his faith, infact lived by it strictly was arrested and excommunicated and perhaps would have suffered even worse if he had not fled. With that constant threat who would openly deny religion? So it's definitely possible that writers and scholars hid their beliefs. We have evidence in their quotes and writings which insinuates a lack of belief. Their interest in the natural world and curiosity for science and questions prove that they were not following and believing in Religion in quite the same way, considering Religion was supposed to have  all the answers, this just proves they were thinking independently from it, so who knows what conclusions they came to. For example Michael Angelo said ""faith in oneself is the best and safest course"" better than the faith in the divine? I'm not saying its proof but surly opens questions, that we can't just slam down and say obviously they were religious because the world back then did not have the same freedoms that we have now.",Ugjmb_UtyV41lngCoAEC,none,7,2016-03-04T20:13:42.000Z,20,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.7614

Sally Lee,"The problem with calling The Renaissance not a thing, is you have to define a thing is. And to do that you have to define the context in which something is a thing. John Green did neither of these while calling The Renaissance not a thing. 

To illustrate this, let us look at the example of classical music. By this I do not mean all of the music composed between the Medieval ages to modern time following the Western European tradition. I am referring to the classical period of music, lasting between 1750 and 1820, comprised most notably of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. 

1. Much like the first wave thinkers and artists of Renaissance, Haydn did not intend on starting a new thing. He didnt make the conscious decision to end Baroque music and start something new called classical music. Neither Mozart nor Beethoven acknowledged that they were leading a whole new movement in music
2. Most of the population did not enjoy this music and were unaware this change during the classical period, much like how the peasants were unaware of the arrival of The Renaissance
3. Furthermore, the three notable classical composers have greatly different sounds in their work. In fact, most people cant even hear how the latter composers were influenced by their predecessor(s). At least artists of The Renaissance had a common springboard for aesthetics.

So, is the classical period a thing? It very much is!

You might point out that the classical period lasted only 70 years, whereas The Renaissance lasted 200 years, making it easier for the classical period to be a thing. However, consider the predecessor of the classical period  Baroque. The Baroque period lasted just under 200 years, and it is very much a thing as well. In fact, we still refer to music composed during this period as Baroque music.

The thing is, most periods and movements in art, literature, music and architecture were not meta enough to have named or defined itself during its own time. These periods were defined and named by scholars much later, for the sole purpose of being able to discuss them with ease. If I didnt have the phrase The Renaissance, Id have to refer to it as that period between 14th and 17th centuries in Europe, when art, architecture, philosophy etc of initially Italians, but later also other Western Europeans, became focused on Greek and Roman aesthetics and philosophy etc. And this long phrase is probably not as encompassing as the simple term The Renaissance.

Therefore, The Renaissance is very much a thing.",UghYCRlwC3lE53gCoAEC,none,1,2015-12-14T22:46:09.000Z,22,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.7121

Aeric Cinema,"Your point about our projection of a false narrative upon history is EXTREMELY accurate.

However, defining the Renaissance as ""not a  thing"" because of the fact that it seems to be a series of many, interdependent ""things"" that happened over centuries and therefore built up as a ""sequence"", making the Renaissance ""not a thing"", is debatable.

When you see into any event of history, into any ""thing"" (a war, for example), it often becomes evident that the ""thing"" is not actually just one single sequence, but is in fact a series of many interdependent elements, all happening on a microscopic scale.

The difference with the Renaissance is that it is a ""thing"" that happened with interdependent elements happening on a MACROSCOPIC scale.

He sorted knowledge into different branches including logic, metaphysics (although that's not what he called it), physics, psychology, biology, poetics, rhetoric etc. He was wrong about some things and he was right about some things.

Damian Sellus,"Wealth is definitely a supporting factor, but there has to be more. There's and underlying reason, social evolution and enlightenment. Which comes from human curiosity and contact with a broader world. The competition between Italian states also fostered this, bc governments in high competition must try harder to justify there pretenses to greatness. So human curiosity is not suppressed as usual, bc it can be inconvenient. And when it was inconvenient they in power reacted as usual. And they did understand themselves as living in a new era, guilds for example also participated in ""the renaissance"". Renaissance men where highly respected in their time. Another part of the renaissance was republicanism, the state as a work of art, they celebrated in the squares with fireworks ever more elaborated, there was a spirit of the times. At least in cities, it touched everyone. So did the reaction, Sovanarola.

Without this secularity, there would have been no possiblity of backlash from a relgious tyrant like Savonarola.

kkestrel150,"Y'know, especially with videos like these, I go to the comments looking for wise individuals and historians, who can help enlighten me on some of these points, perhaps add a little background. Occasionally, those wise individuals might give us a few counter points, a few arguments against certain events, backed up with other evidence or a different interpretation of the meaning of those events.

Instead, the comments are covered, for the most part, with people who feel the need to bash Islam or christianity. They use this video as proof that a certain group of individuals are bad, or superior, or anything else.

Is it really so difficult to have intellectual discussion, without feeling the need to bash people and their ideas?",UgiXy8A1qYSkQngCoAEC,none,3,2015-08-08T12:36:20.000Z,12,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9277

Graham6762,"Plato could very well be right that the universe is 2 dimensional and that learning is actually remembering from the knowledge that the universe endowed us with when we were born. Euclid and his mathematics are right and Aristotle's politics is absolutely brilliant. His biology was the founding book and his logic was the founding book as well. Parmenides may be right that time is just a mental construct and that the motion we see is already there and pre-arranged. The Greeks had thousands of ideas that are far from being wrong or disproven. Democritus was already proven right about the atomic theory. Though it is similar to the atomic theory of gases then the way atoms actually behave in a vacuum. They are odorless and of all different sizes. They are in perpetual cyclical motion which he stated. Aristotle's ethics coming from a non modern day politically correct jewish point of view are genius. Nowadays he would be regarded as an insane racist who probably wouldn't even be able to get a minor teaching post.  The enlightenment was the rediscovery and building off of Greek/Egyptian/Roman sciences.  It was the catholic church that generally funded these endeavors which jews hate to say.  Coepernicus worked for the church and Julius II who was a badass pope commissioned many of these geniuses to paint which supplemented their income so they could continue their endeavors into new discoveries in math, biology and metallurgy.

Tocqueville,"Could you be a bit more honest when it is about Europe?

Dear Mr. Green,

I doubt you will read this but one can hope! :-)

Overall, I really like your work but (and it is a big BUT) there is something I find truly disturbing about it: your bringing down of Europe most of the times.

I do not understand why you do it. On the one hand, I see what you are going for i.e. fighting Eurocentrism.

On the other hand, there is absolutely NO NEED to trash Europe and the West at all times.

If the video is about Renaissance, why does it become on Ottomans sort of ""leading"" it in your eyes?

It is nonsense. And you are too smart not to know that.

And what you are saying about Renaissance is true for every label. Was ""Enlightenment"" for everybody? Of course not! We create labels ex-post to think about things.

I am sure that you could be non Eurocentric without being so ideological about it. You run the risk of fighting a mistake by replacing it with another one.

Thank you.

JM Salamanca,"Why people think of history as a simple string of events? Historical periods are much complex and looooong term than simple events such as a geographic discoveries, wars or revolutions.So the renaissance was a thing, because as you said, it was ""a lot of mutually interdependent things that ocurred over centuries"", and let me add, in a particular part of the world: Europe (mostly Italy but also Western and Central Europe.) Your point of view is justanachronic: just because therenaissance seems like a very long period of time, much longer than recent historical events (like the creation and development of the United States), doesn't mean that ""it was not a thing"" (WTF does that mean anyway?!) With that argument you can also say that classical antiquity orprehistory, that were much longer periods than the renaissance, were neither ""a thing.""",UgiEaHooNtWZ9ngCoAEC,none,11,2015-04-01T22:48:54.000Z,22,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9309
RonaldReaganRocks1,"I see people agreeing that periodization is bad, and I see people correctly stating that the Renaissance did happen even if it only affected a certain slice of the population, and only a certain slice of learning. If you can prove that something actually happened and that it was markedly different from the time period before it, then it existed. The Renaissance definitely happened, and it was definitely a time of shifting in the arts, philosophy, and the humanities in general. It is definitely the time period in which the classical arts of Greece and Rome were rediscovered and the sensibilities of the humanities definitely shifted away from medieval scholasticism and other medieval sensibilities. What is undeniable, and what I think John Green is getting at, is that our classification of a time period is an oversimplification. I don't know if historians even are intending to deceive, or if their classification is as nuanced as it should be, and the way that classification is taught comes across as oversimplified, because we are trying to teach relatively stupid people things, and they need things simplified for them. Even if the Renaissance only affected 5% of the population and didn't affect all disciplines of society, it still happened. I can see what John is saying: if you walked up to a farmer during this time period, and asked him if he agreed that he was living in the Renaissance, he might have no idea what you are talking about, especially if neither farming nor any of the aspects of his life had changed. Periodization gives too much of an impression that all things changed in a period and were all encompassing, as if every single thing had changed from one era to another. It is better to think of periods as trends that became en vogue and popular, and then faded out. While these are on a much smaller, less significant scale, I have lived through the grunge era of the '90s and the emo era of the 2000s, and it is easier to think of periods like that. Did every aspect of my life change? No, but some of the more conspicuous things like music and fashion did. So did some of the sensibilities, philosophies, beliefs and pieces of technology. However, I am largely the same person, and people are generally the same from period to period, if they live that long.",UgilLGKhvRiW1XgCoAEC,none,0,2015-04-01T04:40:17.000Z,4,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9042

John Mars,"Every historian nowadays knows that periodization is wrong. The Renaissance was much less a ""historical period"" and more of an intellectual and artistic revolution that happened in the course of three centuries. One cannot say that ""It did not happen"" because quite simply it's effects were immediately felt in the scientific and intellectual world. For example Erasmus was invited to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor as a councilor, Dante and Cervantes became celebrities only a few years after their deaths, Shakespeare was read by the Elizabethan nobility, the frescos and statues in the churches were open for all too see. True, the effects of the Renaissance would not mature until the 16th century, but arguably by then the European world was already ready to leave both classical civilization for good and go towards an ""Age of Enlightenment"". Thus while the Renaissance was not an event like a battle, it was certainly an event in intellectual and artistic history that had very little to do with outside sources such as Muslim or Theological writings and more to do with the professionalization of secular sciences and arts.


Also, I'm a leftist but sorry John Green but even I can't accept this revisionist history that the Ottomans somehow aided to the coming of the Renaissance. If anything the Ottomans were the reason why the Italian Renaissance declined. Most of the trade exports of the Italian city-states went to central and western Europe. The prime materials for this trade to be possible came entirely from the mediterranean through the Indian Spice trade. The Venetians and Genoans facilitated this trade by way of their Greek colonies in the Aegean and Ionian seas. This trade firstly abruptly ended with the fall of Constantinople, which then was followed by the almost total territorial loss of their colonies by the Ottomans barring them completely from the Spice trade. Hence the incentive to discover India and the journey of Columbus.",Ugiwi2rngwKFeXgCoAEC,none,452,2015-03-18T14:15:04.000Z,14,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.7545

Dietrich Hoefer,"I would love to hear everyones opinion in the idea that it was not just wealth that allowed the Renaissance to emerge.
While certainly trade did bring wealth and information, I think it would be the fact that this wealth and information was able to exist in City-States that allowed the biggest change. Without the existence of smaller 'nations' (appropriate word?), the effects/profits of trade would have been diffused to almost nothing. As well, the information that was 'rediscovered' was heavily focused on the ideas of individualism and specialization (economic, artistic, and otherwise). In larger nations, where governance was a greater consideration, these topics of discussion may have been simply too radical to be considered.
Wouldn't both wealth and information be considered dangerous if it was introduced into an a larger state with a more diverse population? Wouldn't larger governments have more effective means to repress these 2 things in a time when mass production/communication was not present (pre-printing press)?
There seems to be many effective arguments that can be made to the role city-states (and their social dynamic) had in bringing the Renaissance...

Just like medieval times is not one specific year as well as Ancient Greece, which lasted for hundreds of years. Era and date is not the same. And saying that only the aristocrats could sense the ""presence"" of the renaissance is wrong as well. The creation of the printing press, made it possible for more people to read and learn, without it costing a fortune. Of course some people won't take part in the cultural revolution, but its just the same in todays society. I am not sure what era we are in now; information? Atomic? but no matter, there are billions of people who live mor or less like they did a thousand years ago. Still we do not say that we all live in the early medieval times.",Ughk6CslsbyMrngCoAEC,none,1,2015-01-15T16:43:04.000Z,16,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.1447

muk as,"Stating that the Renaissance didn't happen is an interesting point of view, but is not by any means a fact. If only 1% of the population experienced it does that mean that it didn't happen? In the 1970s when people living in the Siberian forests came in contact with the outside world they didn't know that the 2nd world war ended because they didn't know there was a war. Does that mean that the 2nd world war wasn't a thing? How many people need to be experiencing it to say that it happened. The war changed the world in many aspects as did the Renaissance. It changed it from the top down, because it changed the governments etc. Causality works in different ways, there are chain reactions. If some peasant didn't experience Michelangelo's art first hand it doesn't mean that it didn't affect him somehow.

The Renaissance didn't have a concept attached to it until many years later, but it's the same for many things. It's impossible to see anything in it's entirety while it's still happening, because it's not in it's entirety yet. People still at this day say that the Sun rises and sets while knowing that saying so is factually incorrect. Does that mean that the scientific revolution hasn't happened either, because it doesn't affect everyone everywhere in every aspect of life.",Ugj5KyWi6QiRrXgCoAEC,none,241,2015-01-03T20:22:15.000Z,20,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.9546

I think you downplay the Renaissance period. That small percentage of ""enlightened"" intellectuals pushed education which eventually, by twisted and treacherous paths (the hallmark of all good ideas put into motion by the hands of humans, it seems), like the several European wars, the American and the FrenchRevolutions,leaked down to the core of society and spawned the monstrosity we know as today's world.

 Though I cannot discern whether to trust the information I obtain from your videos as true, I allow it to foster new questions of inquiry; these questions can sometimes turn into study. A student must remember that we are all taught by teachers with educated opinions, no matter the subject (yes, math too). As students and seekers of knowledge it is up to us to find and accept the truths that we may find. Crash Course has inspired new thought and perspectives that challenge my own. However, I walk away with only a thought, not a conclusion, a belief, etc. This is how I have come to understand the world: to build a scheme of world that has as many ideas and viewpoints as possible. This principle helps me understand my surroundings, nothing else. To look at the world with the idea of who is right or who is wrong can lead to suffering, anger, and bitterness; though I do not mean to say that there are not people who can be either, but it is up to the individual to decide who is right and who is wrong. Let discussion foster such thoughts so the world may grow. However I am sad that several of the strong perspectives use derisive terms.

sinder9737,"I know most of the comment here are freaking out about how he down plays the AMAZING GOD-GIVEN SUPER DUPER period we all call the Renaissance but i think hes just trying to convey the fact that we do over play it. Was is super cool that science and art FINALLY made a come back? heck yea. But if you really look at it that was the case in MANY places at different points in history and the Renaissance just is another one of those points but we all applaud it because it basically lead to industrialization and advancement of science instead of being crushed unlike all other periods of growing science. We remember theRenaissance because so many great ideas and objects came out of it but he is right it really just built on what came before, like every other age/era. TheRenaissance is romanticized as some amazing wellspring of all things good but really very few contributed anything of value. It was those few that are worth lauding over not the period itself.

He also is conveying that the world as a whole is part of history. Just as what we have today is largely a result of things from theRenaissance, theRenaissance is largely due to other forces including Muslim scholarship along with Greek works. We just remember Renaissance better because it was more recent and we have more paintings, writings and other stuff still around to point to and say LOOK, ISN'T THIS COOL?

He's not saying the whole section of time is irrelevant he's saying we don't look at it subjectively enough compared to most other times and that it was more a smattering of advances that took a LONG time to happen rather than some magical time we like to say it is.

TLDR; Did important things happen in theRenaissance? Absolutely,Yes. Was it a magical time where humanity was transformed? No. A small few made advances that lead to more advances but those advances were really just building upon the advances of before.

Example if modern optics starts with ( or is influenced) Ibn Al Haytham, why do the spectaclesyou wear originate not from the Islamic world but the European one your ancestors originate from?

Heliocentrism most certainly does not start with the medieval world it goes way back toAristarchus. As for Copernicus somehow plagiarizing, you've cited absolutely jack shit evidence that he took his ideas from anyone. However don't tell me you've probably found the minority view of one! and you just know that it is going to be another westerner Islamic Apologist who hates their own culture. 

So recap Aristarchus produced the Heliocentric system this was not accepted in his time. It is re-discovered by Copernicus and then all the other works by other great Europeans ie Johannes Kepler, Galileo etc comes out of this. ultimatelythat lead to the industrialrevolution, and the world you and everybody else lives in today.

With Greco-Roman art though, it was like ""Here we were at peace so it's a bunch of people in sports poses, then here we were at war so heres all the soldiers and victories, and then here is where we started trade so these sculpture are of people that are not absolutely Godly greek men.""",UghIeA5MralwR3gCoAEC,none,0,2014-10-01T20:03:00.000Z,20,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.7517

The movement from the stone age through the bronze and finally the iron age didn't happen in a couple of hundred years either. It was the start of a (movement) as the renaissance was a start. Mr. Green can blow smoke up ones else's keister if he thinks just a few saw the movement. For almost a thousand years Europe was just trying to live through a day with hungry, sickness and death. Some in Europe started waking up from their coma. Art was used as tool by the powerful to CONTROL the people in the country sides and villages. The Medici family were pro's at doing this. Showing off great works of art to the peasants was their way showing how to think about God and how that God had bless the powerful Medici's with riches and made one them a Pope. The lowly soul that saw these wonders, told the others suffering in the county side. I used the Medici family as a example, but they weren't the only ones to use these tactics. Rome did a great job of it too. The Turks did indeed help save Europe from its self. They held on to the knowledge thatEurope let die and blow away in the wind.The renaissance did have start. As with all movements, it starts with a few and grows from there. I could go on, but this Mr.Green isn't worth it. If he really wants to talk European history, I'm up for that match. Fact by fact.

MaximusLight,"You know having been to Europe and looked at some of their self-pro ported history the Renaissance was not a big deal because these things were rediscovered. The reason they are stated to be the enlightenment is because of:
1. the printing press which made it so there was actually a reason to learn to read because books and knowledge were now accessible and...
2. People were starting to speak out against the corruption that was present in both the Catholic Church and the kings and nobility (which basically ran Europe at the time and why it roughly coincides with the Protestant reformation).
This in Europe is what marks the beginning of the ""modern era"" or the renaissance not simply the art and cultural rediscovery.
Basically this marks the time when conditions STARTED to allow for everyone to become ""Enlightened."" This of course does not mean he is wrong about the blatant Euro-centrism or the fact that as a whole they really weren't that ""enlightening"" to the general people, it's simply that this marks the beginning of things starting to change to allow this to happen.
The printing press marks the beginning of the ""Enlightenment"" and is the reason it's said to have happened, not the rediscovery of art and literature.",UghObuJUWjvwe3gCoAEC,none,0,2014-08-24T19:48:25.000Z,19,Vufba_ZcoR0,-0.017

Any other way of teaching seems to me at least, to present itself as inferior in maintaining my interest and understanding, thereby failing its basic purpose.. I would argue that any teacher who fails to teach their students what they're learning in the first 10 minutes should not be allowed to teach that subject because they themselves do not understand it well enough yet.

Jarkko Voutilainen,"What was this talk about Islamic world preserving these classics to pave way to rebaissance, but then suddenly mebtioning the turks conquest of Constantinopole driving schilars with their classics with them into the west? So in other words, the Islamic world didn't introduce these works in here, the byzantines did. Why make such muslim pandering attempts? The arabs who translated these works in to arabic, were Christian and Jews living under Muslims, so I don't know why is so much pains taken to ensure that muslims must be dragged in to this story, is it some multiculti demand these thays that we must not forget to praise Islam every now and then?
In the end, arab conquerors collected writings and stuff from the conquered people into their house of wisdom in Baghdad, this doesn't mean they introduced this stuff to the west; they in fact, learned it from europeans first and did build on them somewhat and now brag about inventing stuff that others, actually, taught them. Seeing how muslim world had a very short time of scientific leadership position and how the later generations ignored their own scholars, speaks against this idea that muslims would have had something to really offer to europe, or that their culture would have inspired scientific learning that helped to pave way to renaissance. This was nonsense.

TRUTH HUNTER,"I see Europeans as the first THUGS of the human race. The CANCER of civilization and the real problem of world peace. Our first and most talked about and established Gangsters are Europeans. And other fools tried to copy what they looked up to as powerful. Age of Discovery
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Cantino planisphere 1502, earliest surviving chart showing the explorations of Columbus to Central America, Corte-Real to Newfoundland, Gama to India and Cabral to Brazil. Tordesillas line depicted, Biblioteca Estense, Modena
The Age of Discovery is a historical period of European global exploration that started in the early 15th century with the first Portuguese discoveries in the Atlantic Archipelagos and Africa, as well as the discovery of America by Spain in 1492, and the discovery of the ocean route to the East in 1498, and by a series of European naval expeditions across the Atlantic and later the Pacific, which continued until the 18th century. It is sometimes regarded as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era, along with its contemporary Renaissance movement. European overseas expansion led to the rise of colonial empires, with the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the Columbian Exchange: a wide transfer of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases and culture between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. This represented one of the most-significant global events concerning ecology, agriculture, and culture in history. European exploration allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations acknowledging each other, reaching the most-remote boundaries much later.
No other human race bothered other races like the Europeans. They did not make things better,things are worse off from it. We have the mental after effects from being filled with hate. And many races can't just get out from under it. What's been done has run thru the races from generation to generation. And all one have to do is just watch any civil rights movie and just watch the behavior of Europeans. They are PURE evil if it's put into them by their parents. No history recorded that explains this evil towards blacks or any other race. No human race shows what did one do, to Europeans that justify their treatment.

I think you'd need to study the art of the period in addition to the history in order to fully grasp what the rebirth brought about. Secularism is a product of the enlightenment two to three centuries later. Primarily in france. In other countries, religion was still key, although the FREEDOM of religion was what sought after, not the absence of religion.

Jessica Lakis,"Actually the term ""Renaissance"" WAS coined in the Renaissance by an Italian author describing the artists and architects of his day, although I'm guessing he used the Italian or Latin equivalent and not the French. As far as to whether 'regular' people experienced the benefits thereof, I'd argue that they did, especially in the long term. Certainly the artists and scholars did in the form of paying work. The tradespeople and merchants of the Italian republics certainly had an increased standard of living, plus they had some say in their own governance. There was the re-introduction of the concept of public works, such as city-planning, and water and sewage systems. The introduction of the movable-type printing press meant a freer exchange of ideas and rising literacy, as well as the founding and expansion of centers of learning, creating (better, at least) lawyers, doctors, and, importantly for Mr. Green, scholars. Away from the Italian peninsula, England experienced an increase in trade, a rising middle class, and moved away from the feudal system of government towards Parliamentary rule. In the German states, the wide-spread publication of what might have been a minor theological squabble turned into a complete split with the Roman Catholic Church. This was appealing to: a) Princes who wanted greater autonomy in their rule, and B) The average Christian who found intellectual and political empowerment in the idea that they ought to be able to read and interpret Scripture on their own without intercession from priestly classes. I'd like to add that while Mr. Green seems naturally inclined to this subject matter because his interests lie in the humanities, his tendency to use Italian (and Greek) stereotypes is troubling. When he speaks of China there are no references to Charlie Chan or depictions of people speaking in blurbs of Peking Duck, but the Italians in several of these videos are depicted as pizza tossing, cartoon turtles or mustachioed plumbers from an old video game, and speak in blurbs of olives. Why is this OK? I find this disconcerting from a White male who hails from a place where a wedge of iceberg lettuce topped with mayonnaise and yellow cheese is considered a salad. Also, if you would like to assert that there had been others who had worked with the idea of the heliocentric solar system, and there were, even in Ancient Greece, then you might want to cite some sources. Actually, cite sources in general. I'm not going to take what you say on faith because you're on the internet, which has a dubious reputation for facts.",UggLlDs4UiibqngCoAEC,none,10,2014-07-17T13:07:04.000Z,13,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9337
GreenbloodLady,"I'm not entirely certain that you can classify the Renaissance as ""not happening"" simply because the vast majority of people didn't experience it at the time. Certainly your definition of what the Renaissance entails can be fluid, but just because it didn't seem terribly important at the time doesn't mean it was nonexistent. It was simply an event that lasted hundreds of years instead of a decade or two and was restricted to the elitist of the elite. It was still present, as evidenced by the fact that today, we DO marvel over many of the works of art created/rediscovered during this time period.

Eric Tarnowski,"I would agree with most stuff here, except your assertion that the Renaissance wasn't a ""thing."" I would argue that it is, because like most cases throughout history, change is not traceable to a single event. It happens gradually. You do like to mention trade, and i would agree that global trading was more important than the Renaissance, but by that same logic, trade wouldn't be important either. It may have taken a while, but Renaissance ideas DID spread around, JUST LIKE trading in the Indian Ocean. I'm sure the places taking part in global trading didn't become instantly affluent. However, it does make more sense to refer to the Renaissance as the time period in which the paradigm shift in thought and culture occurred, rather than the shift itself.

I actually studied this at the university (theology class by Prof. Dr. H.W.

He said that lots of things that Aristotle taught, are different from what the bible says.

Ross Alexander Scott,"The problem with Green's view that the Renaissance didn't happen is that he's looking at the Renaissance as a period as opposed to a movement. Look at it as a movement, beginning in Italy and spreading out to the rest of Europe, changing architecture, art, writing, and ideology. While it did by large only affect a small portion of the population - namely the elites - this is true of almost all historical events in this time. At the end of the day it doesn't matter to a peasant in the fields who he's paying taxes to or who he swears fealty to or who he sells crops to - his life is still ruled by the sun rising and setting, to paraphrase his Green's own statement.",UgiVBRtiFTTPl3gCoAEC,none,0,2014-05-16T17:07:41.000Z,17,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.0583

wotan237,"Note how Mr. Green uses subtle psychology to make his shaky point. He sets up the primacy of trade, then says Copernicus most likely not only got his ideas but his very theorems from a Turk-Arab text, presumably derived from this 'trade'...also it is strongly implied that Copernicus never admitted his debts to other foreigners for his work. Somehow all this, with the notion that Aristotle was always wrong ( he wasnt, esp in marine biology ,logic, and many other areas...plus the allegation that only a fraction of the people ever even felt this so called Renaissance.( not true) ... means that there was no Renassance, but we all know the work of Copernicus arrived well after the (alleged?) start of said Renaissance. What Green omits is the unique contribution of the ecumenical council held in Florence around 1460,, and subsequest learned society that sprung up around Medici Florance. Cardinal Nicolas of Cusa helped spearhead this movement, which did indeed go on to create a larger middle class, a more numerous literate society, (book printing after 1453 exploded, but I guess Green will next claim that a Turk actually printed the Gutenberg Bible, lol) .... The Renaissance accelerated modern concepts of science and scientific knowledge gradually became much more widespread, (Kepler) infrastructure expanded, and the age of navigation and exploration coincided with the advance of the Florentine and later northern Renaissance. Mr. Green will do almost any deceptive slight on hand or mind to avoid acknowledign the validity of Eurocentric views, but he has to like it or lump it.

( To help convince us, next time actually present us with the Arab text in question that Copernicus supposedly plagiarized, then juxtapose that with a scholars direct evidence that the plagiary actually happened.

the renaissancewas not only the painting and reading stuff but it was al lot about how people viewed their lives and their religion
before the renaissance people would live their whole lives bealiving in heaven and being afraid that they might go to hell, so they did everything that they should according to any priest that told them to.
wereas people after the renaissance were much more optimistic and prefered life before death, they still wanted to live a good life, but they would try to combine it to living a fun life.
agreed, it took a long time and nobody ever woke their kids to tell them that it was happening but that doesn't mean that it didn't happen, same goes to the industrial revolution or the rise of any religion or the agracultural revolution",UghUIr_xyu5jangCoAEC,none,0,2014-04-10T18:52:42.000Z,18,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.7218

His metaphysics, specifically his critique of Plato's Theory of Forms are so rigorous and eloquent they crack his entire worldview open.

Jackson Graham,"Okay, I liked the video, but the reasoning behind the Renaissance (or lack thereof) is kind of hard to get behind.

You argue that nobody woke their kids up for the radical shift in European culture towards one based on humanism and trade. Thus, the Renaissance never happened. That's sort of the same argument as ""Nobody ever woke their kids up between 1945 and 1950 and said 'We're a Global Superpower!', so thus, the rise of the US to the global stage never happened.""

Just because a radical shift can't be measured in a short period of time does not mean that the shift is a natural part of the progression of history. Look at it this way: for nearly 1000 years, Europe was a hodgepodge of angry kingdoms, famine, religious fervor, and intellectual stagnation, with the remains of Greco-Roman knowledge hidden in monasteries or overseas in the Abbasid caliphate. In the mid-1450's, that changes. City-states gain ridiculous amounts of power, culture, and wealth in decades, where their contemporaries like England and the Holy Romans took 400-odd years. I'm pretty certain that qualifies as having its own name and time period.",Ughi70gA480sdngCoAEC,none,0,2013-12-18T05:23:45.000Z,5,Vufba_ZcoR0,0.9082

Florence Kickham,"actually many of the ""secular"" works of the renaissance have hidden religious ideas, for instance many art historians believe that the ""Birth of Venus"" by Botticelli is a representation of the immaculate conception. Also the secular works of the renaissance are not denying religion they are just transitioning focus onto people and mythology. To be Catholic was not second guessed by people during the renaissance, they simply extended their beliefs rather than denying their own church.

Anna Wandel,"While discussing the Renaissance in my AP Euro class, the topic of the religious affiliation of the thinkers, artists, etc. was breached. In that discussion, my class reached the conclusion that it was possible that the religious images were most often created because, what is now known as the Catholic Church, had the money and was able to fund the artistic ventures; in short, artists depicted religious scenes in their art to get paid.   So how can you prove that they were or weren't religious?

It is a mistake to view it as a process of world history, as a universal ""new age"" compared to the medieval ""darkness"".

It's so true that Renaissance was part of long process, which had it's own ups and downs. For instance Aristotle was actually rediscovered (yes, from Arabic copies)  back in 13th century.

ExtantFrodo2,You'd expect both evolution and a designer to not toss out working templates should you not? But should you expect an intelligent designer to also copy broken templates (and to also do so in strict adherence to a nested hierarchy) - having unbroken ones in some branches while keeping the broken ones strictly within the same branch? Mindless evolution has no other option than this whereas an intelligent designer would have to deliberately restrict his ingenuity to lineage exclusive paths. There are wonderful abilities of various species that are confined to those species. Why can't you regrow a limb like salamanders do? Why do most animals make their own vitamin C but humans do not? Darwin's Theory of Evolution answers these questions. Tells you how it happened. "God did it" explains nothing. It's just an empty assertion.,UgyeU0RwilFEYaLW4j54AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T01:26:21.000Z,1,P3GagfbA2vo,0.7514

No Name,"In spite of their best efforts, even the devout evolutionists have not so far been able to give any satisfactory answer to the following questions, nor there is any likelihood that the future will enable them to;

(a) Where are all the in-between stages or links of the evolutionary chain in either the fossil record or in the record of living things today?

(b) Why is it always the same story that the intermediate transitional links between major groups of plants animals are missing? Why do the major groups of complex organism always appear suddenly, separa-ted by structural gaps from members of other groups?

Simon Palmer,"Great video! But considering all the information you've gathered the map at 4:07 seems to be one really big error. That is because that is in no way the extent of the Mongol Empire in 1227. Genghis Khan did not conquer all that territory. The Mongol conquests into Europe and the Middle East happend under the leadership of Ghengis' succesor and son, gedei, and the Khagans following him. The conquest of the Song Dynasty and various lands in the far east happend under Kublai Khan. And the empire reached it's greatest extent, which is shown in this map, not in 1227 but in 1279. So that entire section is a pretty massive mistake. 

Another mistake is in 5:40, where it is claimed that the Mongol Empire split up into various Khanates after Ghengis' death. This is completely true. But you are implying, whether intentioanlly or not, that this split happend quickly. It didn't. The Empire remained united during the rules of gedei, Gyuk, and Mngke, although disputes did lead to a civil war after the latters death in 1259. Kublai Khan's reign saw the empire remain as a whole, but only nominally. The definite split of the empire came after Kublai's death in 1294, a long, long time after Ghengis' death. 

These are the two main criticisms i have about this video. The remainder of the video is great nonetheless. I'd just suggest that more thorough research be done when it comes to territorial gains, and that the split should have more information as to why and when it happend, and not imply incorrect things.",Ugxiia1e4WZRkzLK0294AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T21:14:07.000Z,21,szxPar0BcMo,-0.9263

Cathy Keller,"Im the education consultant for this series. Though Darwins thoughts on race did evolve over his career, in Origin of Species Darwin provided a supposedly scientific explanation for the so-called inferiority of colonized and exploited people and of women...In the Origin of Species Darwin allowed that on the scientific scale of evolution, white men were more highly evolved and accomplished than either men of other races or women of any race. (Smith, Bonnie G. Women in World History: 1450 to the Present. London, Bloomsbury
     Academic, 2020. ) It then quotes Darwin directly.  With women the powers of intuition, of rapid perception and perhaps imitation, are more strongly marked than in a man [and characteristics of the lower races, and there fore of a past and lower state of civilization.  (The quote is from Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relationship to Sex. (New York: D Appleton, 1879 [1871]]), 563)

There was indeed a disagreement over the Spanish throne in 1870, which led to the Ems Dispatch, etc. There was also a 1867 dispute over who would rule Luxembourg that almost led to France and Prussia going to war. So by 1870, the relationship was already quite tense. Basically Bismarck had secretly promised France control/dominion over Luxembourg if France stayed out of the Austrian-Prussian war.

fallout fable,My vision for the future of a.i is that yes we can teach it but that doesn't mean it will learn from us as how ai development is currently the ai will have more mechanical function but if the a.i is programed to learn via inviroment or via example we can begin teach it to form new code that relates to it's inviroment or example that is presented to it we can predict what it will learn but we will not be able to understand it completely tell we have discovered the meaning of production of code via code can do and how exactly does the ai presive the code dose it use an algorithm to read the new code that it takes in from it's optical and audio inputs and how dose it learn to Traverse the inviroment or speak when does it begin to speak after you already input the codes for basic understanding or doses it learn from a alfabet tied to audio inputs that where pre set and and visual inputs that gives it the basics for building it's inviroment or dose it learn through interaction these are all things you want to ask yourself when developing an ai and it will help you predict what the ai will learn in most of the ways of the way of learning is external the ai can develop violent tendinces if the people around it use violent means to teach it because it takes in the information it is given and figures out what is the best way to deal with this if that is the core programing and if it is taght from an external means the the code that it is making very well could turn the air violent but if it's an ai that is internally learning it should not have any way to connect with the internet until it has been fausterd to be kind and subsurviant.

CrashCourse,"In regards to a common question in the comments: ""Why was Eugenics bad/bad science, a terrible idea, etc..."" Here are responses from our writer and consultant. Thanks for being curious, y'all! :) 

Response 1: 

Super short version, there were a number of serious problems from the jump.

For one, eugenics assumed that people are like plants or nonhuman animals: driven primarily by instinct, capable of only so much change in a lifetimebasically, products of nature, not nurture, as we say in the episode. In fact, the opposite appears to be true about most traits. Most traits also appear to be multifactorial, meaning that, alas, there is not one gene for awesomeness, e.g., but a complex interaction among several regions of the genome, plus nurture.

Basically, the eugenicists profoundly oversimplified human genetics. They worked before the modern synthesis, so they literally got the math wrong, but moreover, they reduced human nature to a small number of classical genes, which isnt accurate.

But probably the simplest way in which eugenics was bad science was that the core publications behind the discipline were riddled by *serious* basic errors, as I believe we point out re the Kallikak study and Davenports work on race. So, even if eugenics had been right, they screwed up or falsified their own research.

***

Response 2: 

I want to be consistent with our assertion from the beginning that people in the past werent stupid, and that they were trying to make sense of the world around them.  To be fair to the eugenics enthusiasts, we really shouldnt judge their science based on our modern understanding of genetics because that would contradict the historic perspective that weve been trying to argue throughout the series.  We also shouldnt try to say it was bad science from our current moral perspective.

However, we are perfectly within our right to say it was bad science based on early 20th century standard best practices of science, which it totally was.  (Caveat that eugenics started with some scientists doing sorta legitimate investigations, but as it evolved into a social movement, there was significantly more dubious practitioners & applications of science (ie, not really science).)

First point of bad science: In a rush to make genetics responsible for everything, there was a clear blurriness between causation and correlation.  Eugenics proponents would want to look for traits (such as honest/depravity, frugalness/thrift) & look at family patterns.  There might be a very clear hereditary correlation, but that in no way means that a gene is responsible for the trait.  There was a jump to a conclusion that skipped the experimental elimination process that is key to the scientific method.  Many of the traits that the eugenicists were investigating could actually be disproven through twin studies.

Second point of bad science:  Germ theory was finally accepted & genetics seemed to be the next frontier, so lots of people jumped on the bandwagon of redefining disease.  Conditions like feeblemindedness were now categorized as diseases, which needed to be fixed or eliminated.  A hundred years later, we are still discovering what conditions are caused by pathogens, heredity, environment, etc, and we are left with a whole lot of unknowns.  Mostly, what we have learned is that it is a lot more complicated than anyone thought. 

Third point of bad science: Points 1 & 2 werent really tested in any kind of sciency way, ie with control groups, repeatable experiments, double blind parameters.  Granted, lots of those ideas really solidify over the 20th century (partly in response to the bad science of eugenics), but there was enough of an ethos of best practices that definitely shows this wasnt rigorous science.  Eugenics did a lot of data collection & observation  on their own, good aspects of science  but then used that data to look for correlation patterns.

Fourth point of bad science: Eugenicists began conflating poorly defined scientific causes, like feeblemindedness (re point 2), with social causes, like poverty or immigration or race, which created a seemingly scientific legitimacy for poorly argued ideas.  This gets more at an ethics position that even the early legitimate scientists allowed dubious science to go mainstream.",UgwI2gLdBtCm_hMsCn94AaABAg,none,283,2018-10-09T18:54:10.000Z,18,JeCKftkNKJ0,-0.8582
Lucas Wanlass,"I honestly dont see an issue with the logic here. If you minus all the bad stuff, and only focusing on the idea of high test takers mating other high test takers, eventually you will get kids who are smarter then average. Im not a scientist so I dont actually know the reality of the situation but I know thats how breeding works. Desirable traits are passed onto the next generation until you get a dog who points at a bird. This works in all animals; Humans are animals, so it will work with humans.

Unless there is damage to the body in some way or reproduction at an age which makes it likely enough to induce Down syndrome.Just like how you cant change a Pit-bull into a Labrador, same species (But different breed) Let me remind you Good Sir, that we are still animals.But are pursuit is to become less prone to non-calculated, impulsive short term based violence.Which, let me remind you decreases a populations predisposition to becoming favorably civilized and capable of maintaining that nature of a longterm generational period.Your analysis is flawed, and if you respond in an overtly emotional manner to this, So is your emotional intelligence.But thats okay , theres always a bell curve.And when two bell curves with two different populations come into co-habitation, there is always mixing (IQ/EQ).",UgxjU6Y7E8SHqooiic94AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-13T14:48:04.000Z,14,JeCKftkNKJ0,0.9617

Phillip Schearer,"I am disappointed that the video glossed over the greatest differences between Plato and Aristotle:  How many realities are there and how do we know?  Plato = two realities, the higher one known by introspection and revelation.  Aristotle = one reality, known by our senses and our logic (which he virtually invented).  The consequences of Platonism in history have been dire, including the Dark Ages and the mass bloodshed of the 20 century.  The consequences of Aristotelianism included the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and the founding of the United States.

Gregory Love,"Egypt (africa) was the true cradle of civilization grooming European scholars ( Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Pythagorus, Hippocrates etc. and teaching the world true essence of civilization.  Black Africans brought Grammar, Rhetoric/ Dialect, Geometry, Medicine,  Science,  Astronomy,  Masonry, Architecture,  Music, Agriculture,engineering,  Mining, Sculpture, Forestry, and Carpentry to the world. Documented historical evidence SHATTERED widely held views that Europeans  were the pioneers of early civilization. Half of humanity's  recorded history has passed anyone in Europe could even learn to read or write. While pharoah's in Egypt were in the process of building their first world- renowned pyramids, Europeans were piling up nothing more than mountains of rubbish heaps. Don't you ever forget that. Schools should teach true history Instead of gassing y'all up.

Course 5: Data Visualizations Part 1

We have 2 types of data  - Quantitative and Categorical
Quantitative Data is numeric and has a meaningful order and is equally spaced e.g. ounces of olive oil per U.S. home
Categorical Data is non-numeric and is not ordered or equally spaced e.g. Which type of pasta is most liked by people ?
Categorical data can be  displayed using a frequency or a relative frequency table (for better comparison)
Frequency table can have more than one variables (e.g. white sauce/red sauce pasta)
Categorical data can also be displayed as bar charts (with one of more variables like frequency table)
It can also be represented by a Pictograph (though increasing the size of the pictures does not                                   give us a better comparison)
It can also be represented as a pie chars (as our eyes are pretty good at comparing pie slices)
Always keep an eye on the axes while reading a visualization
Quantitative variables can also be displayed as categorical variables by binning(categorizing them in groups)
Point to keep in mind is to see the bins are appropriate and are not obscuring the data
A bar chart showing quantitative binned data is continuous (unlike categorical data bar chart) as there is no distinctions and the bins are continuous
Such a chart is called as a histogram",UgyuvZSVDZIcCB8Vc6d4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-10T10:00:46.000Z,10,hEWY6kkBdpo,0.9646

Course 3: Measures of Central Tendency

Measure of central tendency - Tells us something about the nature of the data
Mean= Sum of values/Total no. of values - pulled towards unusually high or low values
Median is the middle value - Can be senseless if there are even no of values e.g. 2 and a half cats
Mode is the most common value - Can be used for numeric and non-numeric data
If data is having two modes, it is bi modal. part of multi-modal distribution
In normal distribution, most common values is in the middle, 
with equal distribution of values on either side of it
Statisticians say normal distribution does not have any skew - mean, median and mode are the same
If this is not the case, then the data is skewed. Median will still be in the middle and mode before or after it.
Mean will be pulled towards the usually high values i.e. the outliers
This shows us that statistics can be deceptive and true at the same time. You got to know the question you are trying to answer and whether the data you have is sufficient to answer it correctly.",Ugx-HnCd3bO4pi8YpAd4AaABAg,none,1,2020-04-10T09:54:25.000Z,9,kn83BA7cRNM,0.9527

THEDON FONZ,"This was very well done ! As a pacific islander, how you explained the Myth of Maui was fairly accurate. 
Like growing up with nothing but polys around me, i first heard of Maui in kindergarten/primary - The Maui is a prominent figure in Maori culture, so naturally here in NZ is grow up knowing about Maui - then you realize that there are scattered stories of this character throughout the Pacific. 


The NZ/Fish story and how he slowed down the sun i've learnt from Maori Mythology. One thing I would like to see here and see is your research on Tagaloa/Tangaloa who was, what is described to be ""GOD"" before Christianity swept through the Pacific.

Lainey Makitamou,"Fishing for New Zealand is actually a Hawaiian myth and legend. The actual myth is similar but it has its differences. 
Story:
As Mui pulled out his fish hook, his brothers laughed at him, and denied him bait for his hook. So Maui hit himself hard on the nose, his nose bleed and covered his hook with his blood. Mui threw his hook into the water down into the depths of the sea, and instantly the hook was taken. The brothers shouted at Mui scared that the boat would tip if he didnt cut the line, but maui held tight to his line and kept pulling. Suddenly, a giant fish towered over their boat (size of New Zealands north island). This fish was said to be gifted to them when the time came. Mui asked his brothers to stay with the fish as he went back to the village, they agreed, but as soon as Mui left the brothers carved huge chunks out of greed. As Mui came with his people they caught the brother arguing over whos part of the fish was theirs. In fact they were so greedy they carved out huge gullies and mountains from the fishs flesh.

Over many hundreds and thousands of years, these gullies and mountains became part of the landscape of Aotearoa as we know it today. Birds, plants, animals and the people of Hawaiki populated the giant fish of Mui. And in time Mui's giant fish became known as the North Island of Aotearoa, and Mui's canoe the South island.",UgzZbDUiIw2RW2Bv88l4AaABAg,none,0,2020-03-13T18:59:31.000Z,18,eBB3RKazIj8,-0.7944

Jessica Bovingdon,"As an Open University student of 3years best advice I would give for retaining information on either laptop or paper is.


a) Colour code- each study topic I would use a colour, recent colour is yellow. Then i use red pen- Theorist/research /policy author, dates or theory. Blue pen outline/advantages, black pen limitations/disadvantages. 


b) Change and vary notetaking, headings and subheadings, to tables and mindmaps. This will freshen your brain.  


Ps. if you are at a live lecture, ask for the powerpoint before or recording if online, ask to record lecture. If neither is an option get ideas down and do the  colour code system after or rewrite, this is time consuming but I guarantee it helps you absorb content better!",UgyegPJUPge-WArWIFd4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-12T12:46:59.000Z,12,E7CwqNHn_Ns,0.8762

But, if negative connotations are harbored against that person or thing then it reduces overall utility since people wouldn't want to work with what they don't like.

Putting the inherent nature of human beings to sort using emotions. It is fair to let people decide what is best for them - what makes them feel comfortable.

Nevertheless, changing beliefs or feelings to accomodate the existence of others might create resistance at first. However, in the long run acceptance would lead to more efficiency. A creation of an environment where consensus doesn't mean compromise.


Er. Help me define factors that would make this statement true.
1. Is it moral to discriminate for the greater good?
2. Is it moral to compromise other people by letting ""odd"" people in?

Ramaraksha,"When it comes to murder there is no such thing as justice - all we can do is Vengeance - Hollywood loves the latter - the Kill Bill movies - something bad happens to the hero/heroine at the beginning of the movie and then the rest of the movie is a blood-fest, the audience blood lust is satisfied & they go home happy. But did the hero/heroine get their loved ones back, did they get their life back? How is it justice when that did not happen?


Some time ago a young child was kidnapped, raped and killed - they caught the attacker - he was known to the family & he now sits in jail might be executed. But regardless of what happens to him how does it help the poor girl whose life was taken away from her? She didn't get to grow up, hang out with friends, first crushes, first dances, college, a career, falling in love, marriage, kids, grand kids! - all the joys of life that the rest of us got to enjoy were denied to her - where is the justice for this kid?
And how about her parents - each and every day the pain lingers - each and every day they miss their kid, her shrieks of laughter, her innocence. As each year passes they would say ""she would be doing this by now..."" - tormenting thoughts that will haunt them until they die
Do they care that the evil person who did this is suffering in jail or is going to be executed?
I totally doubt it
No Justice for these parents either


Crazy thing is that when it comes to religion, poor God can do no better - all he can do is deliver Vengeance - here religion uses it famed forked tongue - they tell the poor grieving parents that the evil person who did this will be dealt with severely by God and then they will go to the criminal and tell him to repent, God is so forgiving, he will forgive and he can scoot off to Heaven!
Regardless of the conniving religion, where are the educated to ask how come God can do no better?
All God can do is deliver Vengeance? Torture the criminal? But that does nothing for the victims as we saw above
And the whole sick concept of forgiveness - not one person points out that Judges do not have that right. No judge can take it upon himself to forgive the criminal, that right is the victims alone! Only the victim has the right to forgive. God is not going to help the criminal cheat their victims

I can't figure out *how* decreasing the volume would cause the gas to cool. It seems to me like if anything, doing that would actually cause the molecules to move even faster, although to an imperceptible amount. And after all, as she said, we're doing work on the system, so unless there's an exit for heat, wouldn't the internal energy increase? Would pushing the piston down not just raise the pressure of the gas in an inverse ratio to keep the left-hand side of the equation of equal value?",Ugx-VgbqUb5AXy08Kqh4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-04T14:09:37.000Z,14,4i1MUWJoI0U,0.8597

Jerome Twigg,"If by good for the economy you mean gross GDP and not average GDP per capita..yeah sure. 
Labour declines significantly in value rendering it less valuable than the minimium wage, resulting in wage stagnation (bad for the poor many) and cheap labour (good for the rich few). 
Demand for housing goes up inflating it's market value (good for those privileged enough to own a second house they can sell at increased profit, bad for those who can't afford a house at all on their depressed income) and increase in rental value (bad for the poor who have to rent, good for the rich who collect rent).
While the gross GDP goes up.. it is concentrated among the wealthy while the poor, including immigrants themselves, get screwed over infinitely.. with the welfare and other social services provided to the migrants being paid for predominately with the tax increases inflicted on the working poor.

Casual Learning,"THE TWELVE COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS 
FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
By John J. Bannan (4/12/2020)

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  Genesis 1:1.  God is the creator of the cosmos.  The cosmological arguments prove the existence of God by demonstrating the necessity of a Creator for the cosmos.  The cosmological arguments offer good reason through circumstantial evidence taken from the nature of the cosmos itself to believe in God.  The following is a listing and explanation of all the known cosmological arguments for the existence of God:

I.	THE DICHOTOMY OF EXISTENCE 
        (BY JOHN J. BANNAN)

The dichotomy of existence proves the existence of God by demonstrating the necessity of an uncaused Creator with the power to create any or all of the infinite potentials for physical reality to the fullest extent logically possible under everythingness.  In terms of the uncaused, there are only two possibilities.  The first is the uncaused reason for the existence of all physical reality.  The second is the uncaused absence of any reality called absolute nothingness.  These two are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all logical possibilities forming an abstract metaphysical dichotomy of existence.  Because each side of the dichotomy is uncaused, there can be no cause for either of the two being real.  Rather, one side is real and the other is not real without reason or necessity.  Moreover, an uncaused thing does not have parts, because it would otherwise be caused by those parts.  Because an uncaused thing does not have parts, an uncaused thing cannot be destroyed because destruction demands the disassociation of parts.  As a result, the side of the dichotomy that is real can never be destroyed, and the other side that is not real can never become real. 

Because physical reality can differ in the most minute way logically possible from another potential physical reality, there is no good reason to believe that the uncaused reason for the existence of all physical reality could not also create that potential physical reality.  Because this uncaused reason can create this potential physical reality, then it can also create another potential physical reality differing from the former potential physical reality in the most minute way logically possible.  Repeating this ad infinitum, this uncaused reason must be capable of creating any or all of the infinite logically possible physical realities called everythingness.  Because potential physical realities can be created, there must be a reason for the existence of physical reality and the creation of any or all infinite potential physical realities.  This reason must be uncaused, because the creation of any or all physical realities is contingent on this reason which leaves this reason without anything else to cause it.  

Because the creation of less than everything that is logically possible is itself a logical possibility falling within everythingness, then this uncaused reason must necessarily be able to decide what to create out of the infinite possibilities for physical reality.  This uncaused reason must have knowledge of all the infinite potentials for physical reality, the power to create any or all of these potentials, and a presence to control, sustain, alter or destroy any such creation.  Moreover, this uncaused reason must have the greatest decision-making ability logically possible in order to be able to create up to the fullest extent of everythingness.  We call this uncaused real side of the dichotomy of existence God.",UgyXs0Eyuuv8uuer6-p4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T13:59:11.000Z,13,TgisehuGOyY,0.9816
Casual Learning,"II.	THE FIRST CAUSE ARGUMENT 
        (BY ST. THOMAS AQUINAS)

The first cause argument proves the existence of God by demonstrating that all causes and effects in the cosmos must ultimately derive from a very first cause we call God.  In the cosmos, we observe that for every cause, there is an effect.  We also observe that every effect is itself a cause for a subsequent effect.  Like a line of falling dominos, the first falling domino causes the fall of the second domino, and the second falling domino causes the fall of the third domino.  The cosmos unfolds as a series of causes and effects over time.

Because an infinite regress in time of causes and effects is impossible, there must be a very first cause of the cosmic series of causes and effects.  We observe that cause and effect in the cosmos follows an order where A causes B, and B causes C, whether the intermediate cause B is only a single cause or several causes.  Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect.  Therefore, if there is no cause A, there will be no ultimate cause C, nor any intermediate cause B.  But, if an infinite regress in time of causes and effects were possible, there would not be a first cause, and so neither would there be an ultimate cause, nor any intermediate cause.  Therefore, the existence of the series of causes and effects over time in the cosmos necessitates a very first cause for the beginning of the series.

The very first cause in the beginning of the cosmic series of causes and effects over time must not itself be caused.  If it were caused, then regress would continue backward in time infinitely, which is impossible.  Moreover, the very first cause cannot be self-created.  It is impossible for a thing to cause itself, because it would have to exist prior to itself.  Therefore, the very first cause must itself be uncaused.  We call this uncaused first cause God.

Because God is uncaused, God cannot be made of parts.  A thing that is made of parts is caused by those parts.  God being uncaused cannot Himself be caused by parts.  We call this principle that God is not made of parts  divine simplicity.  Divine simplicity is a mystery, because we cannot imagine a thing without parts.  However, because we know a very first cause is necessary for the cosmos to be created, and we know that this very first cause cannot be made of parts, we know that divine simplicity is real.  An ancient classical philosophical truth known as ex nihilo nihil fit states that nothing comes from nothing  or that you cant get something from nothing.  Because nothingness cannot create the cosmos, an uncaused very first cause of the cosmos is necessary to which we give the name God. 

III.	THE FIRST ORDER ARGUMENT
        (BY JOHN J. BANNAN)

The first order argument proves the existence of God by demonstrating that the cosmos must have had an initial order created by an uncaused orderless cause we call God.  We observe from the cosmos that everything has an order.  This order is the relative position or arrangement of things in physical reality at any given moment in time.  We observe that this order is caused by an antecedent order, and that this antecedent order is caused by an earlier antecedent order.  Because an infinite regress in time of antecedent orders is impossible, there must be a very first order.  

We observe that order in the cosmos follows a pattern where order A causes order B, and order B causes order C, whether the intermediate order B is only a single order or a series of consecutive orders.  Now to take away order A is to take away order B.  Therefore, if there is no order A, there will be no ultimate order C, nor any intermediate order B.  But, if an infinite regress in time of consecutive orders were possible, there would not be a first order, and so neither would there be an ultimate order, nor any intermediate order.  Therefore, the existence of the series of consecutive orders over time in the cosmos necessitates a very first order for the beginning of the series.  This first order requires an orderless cause, because a first order cannot come from nothing.  A cause without order is a cause without parts, and therefore must be uncaused because otherwise its parts would be its cause.  Because all physical realities possess an order, this orderless cause cannot be any sort of physical reality.  We call this uncaused orderless immaterial cause of first order God.

IV.	THE BEGINNINGLESS TIME PARADOX
        (BY JOHN J. BANNAN)

The beginningless time paradox proves the existence of God by demonstrating that the beginning of time itself must have an uncaused timeless cause we call God.  If time in the cosmos had no beginning, then there would be an infinity of prior moments in time before the arrival of the present moment.  An infinity of prior moments of time could never be fully traversed, because there would always be a prior moment in time that had not yet been traversed because infinity is unending.  If all prior moments in time are not fully traversed, then paradoxically the present moment in time could never arrive.  Because the present moment in time does arrive, then time in the cosmos must have had a beginning.  Because time must have had a beginning, then time must have been caused to begin from something besides nothing because nothing cannot cause anything.

The cause of the beginning of time not having time for its own cause must therefore be uncaused.  Moreover, the cause of time itself cannot be something subject to time, because the existence of anything subject to time is contingent on the existence of time.  The beginning of time itself cannot have a physical explanation, because all physical explanations would be subject to time.  Accordingly, there must be an uncaused immaterial explanation for the beginning of time itself we call God.

V.	THE NECESSARY BEING ARGUMENT
       (BY ST. THOMAS AQUINAS)

The necessary being argument proves the existence of God by demonstrating that there must be some being we call God that exists out of His own necessity in order for contingent beings to exists in the cosmos.  We observe that in the cosmos things come and go into being called contingent beings.  Every being is a contingent being, because objects in the cosmos come into being and pass away.  Indeed, it is possible for those objects to exist or for those objects not to exist at any given time.  For each contingent being, there is a time it does not exist.  Therefore, it is impossible for these always to exist.  Consequently, there could have been a time when no things existed.

If there were a time when no things existed, there would have been nothing to bring the currently existing contingent beings into existence.  Therefore, nothing would be in existence now.  Such an absurd result undermines the assumption that all beings are contingent.  Therefore, not every being is a contingent being.  There must be some being which exists of its own necessity, and does not receive its existence from another being, but rather causes them.  We call this necessary being God.",Ugz_BptxJP5jjQ5cfx54AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T13:58:59.000Z,13,TgisehuGOyY,0.9709
Casual Learning,"VI.	THE ARGUMENT FROM COMPOSITE PARTS
       (BY JOHN J. BANNAN)

The argument from composite parts proves the existence of God by demonstrating that an uncaused singular non-composite we call God is necessary for the existence of all composites in the cosmos.  We observe from the cosmos that all composites are caused by their parts.  Causation itself is the formation of a composite from parts in physical reality.  The cosmos itself is a composite made of parts consisting of each moment in time with its physical reality.  We also observe that composites themselves are made of composites.  However, a composite cannot be made without parts, and because more than one part is a composite, a single part which causes all composites must be real because composites cannot come from nothing.  That single part which causes all composites must be an uncaused non-composite, because parts would otherwise cause it to be a composite.  Because all physical reality forms a composite with spacetime, then the single uncaused non-composite cannot be any sort of physical reality.  We call this single uncaused immaterial non-composite God.

VII.	THE ARGUMENT FROM TIME
       (BY JOHN J. BANNAN)

The argument from time proves the existence of God by demonstrating that the existence of time requires an uncaused timeless cause we call God.  Time is the creation, destruction and re-creation of physical reality at the smallest scale at relative rates.  Because nothing comes from nothing, the cause of time cannot be nothing.  Rather, the cause of time must have a cause outside of time.  This cause of time must also remember the prior order, placement and time flow of physical reality in order to re-create physical reality at every moment in time.  This cause of time not having time for its own cause must therefore be uncaused.  However, the cause of time itself cannot be something subject to time, because the existence of anything subject to time is contingent on the existence of time.  There are no physical explanations for the beginning of time itself, because all physical explanations would be subject to time.  We call this uncaused timeless immaterial cause of time God.

VIII.	THE KALAM COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
       (BY WILLIAM LANE CRAIG)

The Kalam cosmological argument proves the existence of God by demonstrating that the cosmos had a beginning caused by a personal agent that transcends spacetime we call God.  We observe from the cosmos that everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  The cosmos began to exist.  Therefore, the cosmos has a cause for its existence.  The cosmos began to exist, because an actual infinite cannot exist.  A beginningless temporal series of events is an actual infinite.  Therefore, a beginningless temporal series of events cannot exist.  

Actual infinities that neither increase or decrease in the number of members they contain would result in absurd consequences, if they were to exist in reality.  For example, a library with an infinite number of books would not be reduced in size at all by the removal of a specific number of books (short of all of them).  Or, before the present event could occur the event immediately prior to it would have to occur.  But, before that event could occur, the event immediately prior to it would have to occur; and so on ad infinitum.  One gets driven back and back into the infinite past, making it impossible for any event to occur.  Thus, if the series of past events were beginningless, the present event could not have occurred, which is absurd.

The collection of historical events is formed by successively adding events, one following another.  The events are not temporally simultaneous, but occur over a period of time as the series continues to acquire new members.  Even if an actual infinite were possible, it could not be realized by successive addition.  In adding to the series, no matter how much this is done, even to infinity, the series remains finite and only potentially infinite.  One can neither count to nor traverse the infinite.

If something has a finite past, its existence has a cause.  The cosmos has a finite past.  Therefore, the cosmos has a cause of its existence.  Because spacetime originated with the cosmos and therefore has a finite past, the cause of the existence of the cosmos must transcend spacetime.  Because the cause of the cosmos existence transcends spacetime, no scientific explanation in terms of physical laws can provide a causal account of the origin of the cosmos.  Because no scientific explanation can provide a causal account of the origin of the cosmos, then the cause must be a personal agent.  If the cause were an eternal, nonpersonal, mechanically operating set of conditions, then the cosmos would exist from eternity.  Because the cosmos has not existed from eternity, the cause must be a personal agent we call God who chooses freely to create an effect in time.",UgyFsCcxbqaBanztpEh4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T13:58:22.000Z,13,TgisehuGOyY,0.587
Casual Learning,"IX.	THE ARGUMENT FROM SUFFICIENT REASON
        (BY GOTTFRIED LEIBNIZ)


The argument from sufficient reason proves the existence of God by demonstrating that an explanation for the existence of the cosmos is necessary, which must be a transcendent God who has within His own nature the necessity of existence.  We observe from the cosmos that there must be an explanation, or sufficient reason, for anything that exists.  The explanation for whatever exists must lie either in the necessity of its own nature or in a cause external to itself.  A sufficient reason for the existence of the cosmos cannot be another contingent thing (and on into infinity), because to explain the existence of any contingent thing by another contingent thing lacks a sufficient reason why any contingent thing exists.  The explanation of the existence of the cosmos must lie in a transcendent God, because the cosmos does not have within its own nature the necessity of existence and God does.


X.	THE PRIME MOVER ARGUMENT
        (BY ST. THOMAS AQUINAS)


The prime mover argument proves the existence of God by demonstrating that all motion in the cosmos must ultimately be derived from an unmoved mover we call God.  We observe that in the cosmos some things are in motion.  Now whatever is moved is moved by another.  Things move when potential for motion becomes actual motion.  Only an actual motion can convert a potential for motion into an actual motion.  Nothing can be in both potentiality and actuality in the same respect simultaneously.  If both actual and potential, it is actual in one respect and potential in another respect.  Therefore, nothing can move itself.
Each thing in motion is moved by something else.  If that by which it is moved be itself moved, then this also needs to be moved by another, and that by another again.  But this cannot go onto infinity, because then there would be no first mover.  Without a first mover, there would be no movement at all, because all subsequent movers move only inasmuch that they are moved by the first mover.  For example, the staff moves only because it is moved by the hand.  Therefore, it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, moved by no other; and this we call God.


XI.	THE ARGUMENT FROM GRADATION OF BEING
       (BY ST. THOMAS AQUINAS)


The argument from gradation of being proves the existence of God by demonstrating that the existence of all things requires as their cause a maximum being we call God.  We observe from the cosmos that there is a gradation to be found in physical reality.  Some physical things are better or worse than others.  Predications of degree require reference to the uttermost case.  For example, a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest.  The maximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus.  Therefore, there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection.  We call this God.

XII.	THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN
       (BY ST. THOMAS AQUINAS)


The argument from design proves the existence of God by demonstrating that non-intelligent natural things must be directed in their purposes by a supernatural intelligent being we call God.  We observe from the cosmos that natural bodies work toward some goal, and do not do so by chance.  Most natural things lack knowledge.  But, as an arrow reaches its target because it is directed by an archer, what lacks intelligence achieves goals by being directed by something intelligent.  Therefore, some intelligent being is real by whom all natural things are directed to their end.  We call this intelligent being God.",UgwZQxNCgPhoX1b2vFJ4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T13:57:43.000Z,13,TgisehuGOyY,0.9933

Same goes for the life expectancy of the sun, the earth, humanity or even individual humans. If you assume, that there's a God managing all of this, you know that everything will be ok.

As for dark energy: A lot of things happen, that we still can't explain or even imagine. We see the effect, but have no idea how and why it works. Maybe God makes the universe expand directly, who knows?

They guys who go out to the field and pick apples (or mow lawns, or serve fast food) make pretty close to the same money.  One might make a little more with more experience or better performance.  The guy who makes much more money is the entrepreneur who invested in an education, took out loans to buy the land, rented the truck, and took the time/risk to hire the guys to pick the apples.  Now, is it fair that the entrepreneur now makes 10x or 100x more than the guys picking the apples, even though he mostly sits in the air conditioned truck?

The poor are poor but in the middle class they have the biggest gap between perfect distribution and the actual distribution. The rich have the biggest portion of income. The poor are not getting poorer, the rich are just taking a bigger portion then before. The countries with the most income inequality have more violence and crime.

Remedi,"By the way, to whoever is reading this and thinking ""well I don't much like liberalism or conservatism"", there are more than two political ideologies out there.

Do you really love capitalism and really hate the state? (American) libertarianism could be for you
Do you think that capitalism is pretty destructive and that it should be controlled as much as possible? Social democracy could be your game
Do you think capitalism is *really* bad for people? You could always try socialism
Do you hate capitalism and also hate the state? You could go for libertarian socialism (which is actually where the term libertarian originated as a political ideology)
You can have markets without capitalism, you can have markets without the state, you can have capitalism without the state, you could have a strong state and heavy capitalism, you could have capitalism intertwined with the state!
That's not even to get into the social aspects of different positions

Mr. LÃ©on,"God, these videos SUCK! Its videos like these that left me absolutely clueless in History, Government, and AP Government. Stop trying to be so goddamned funny because you arent! Im trying to genuinely learn what the roles of the House and Senate are, and this guy says the Majority Leader Leads the Majority and The Majority Whip whips them into shape... I guess... and some other stuff. These roles were created when black men were considered to be 1/3 of their own being. Maybe not the best joke to make? This didnt even appeal to me on a Middle School level, I literally just felt like I was having to endure my brain melting while being educated by the guy who dropped out of school in his Junior year of high school and somehow stumbled his way into a production studio and someone thought, Oh, hell be GREAT with the kids!

Dorkmax,"The commonalities between Norse and Greco-Roman pantheons is not as coincidental as John Green characterizes. Linguists have identified common features among languages both distant and seemingly disconnected. Sure, we can see commonalities between German and English that suggest a common ancestor, or even French and Italian coming from Latin. But there shouldn't be a link between Latin and Sanskrit. Yet there is. Linguists as early as the 1890s have found links among both modern and ancient languages: Sanskrit, Latin, Proto-Germanic, Ancient Greek, and even early Iranian have been as members of a language family that has been reconstructed and dubbed Proto-Indo-European. Using such a reconstruction, we have identified features of the Pontic steppe culture that spoke it, including traditions, lifestyle, and religion. The pantheon linguists and archaeologists assembled from these language clues shows common RELIGION features. In short, Norse religion and  Greco-Roman seem connected because *THEY ARE*",UgwUqzM9DLXMpsPiXU94AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-11T03:57:30.000Z,3,Wc5zUK2MKNY,0.1655

TREY FRED,"Given the scientific knowledge we have in 2020, two events in our history are a conundrum, that cannot be explained if their is no First Cause, no Uncaused Cause. Which means there is POSITIVE EVIDENCE that there must be an Uncaused Cause. First, Science is the SEARCH FOR CAUSES. Second, By the physics we know today in this world things just don't pop into existence out of NOTHING. Yet the Atheist actually believes in two events that did just that. 1) The universe came into being OUT OF NOTHING AND BY NOTHING--there is NO Cause of the universe.. 2) Life arose from that rock. Now I believe that these two events are positive evidence for the existence of the Uncuased Cause, and from the science we know, it is more probable that ""Something created everything and life. If Darwin had been right that life was a simple mix of chemicals in a type of protoplasm, the story could end their. However, today we have the technology to delve deep into the cellsomething Darwin could only imagine was relatively simple. Today, Carl Sagan said, the amoeba is as complicated as a small city. This city is microscopic, and can travel from place to place. Sagan said the amoeba has 400 milllion bits of data in its DNA--he used the term bits like a computer program in his series the cosmos.  Richard Dawkins compared it to 1000 encyclopedias in the blind watchmaker. This data is so complex, as to exclude the possibility of life coming into being by pure chance. And at the moment of First Life, this is all you have. Mutations, and Natural selection  do NOT start until first life.",UgxRg9yzqzdTAjui0o94AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T21:34:24.000Z,21,UPggkvB9_dc,0.7184
TREY FRED,"Richard Dawkins, and others, admit they don't know how life began, but of course they ""BELIEVE"" they have FAITH
that evolution is true. They also BELIEVE, they have FAITH, by definition--if their is no God--that the Universe Exploded into being 10 to the 18 seconds ago  by nothing and from nothing, a scientific impossibility. Then they BELIEVE, have FAITH, that life (abiogenisis) came from THAT SAME ROCK that exploded 10 to the 18 seconds ago. My point is, at some point, we all have FAITH. The Atheist must ultimately put his FAITH in NOTHING. And the Atheist is headed to NOTHING. I on the other hand, see the hand of a designer, not just because the Bible says so, but because math dictates a designer to the universe. Nothing
cannot produce everything. Non life, cannot produce life since LIFE NEEDS DNA for self replication. Carl Sagan equates DNA to bits of data, like in a computer code. Richard Dawkins calls it a computer tape, and Bill Gates says its the most sophisticated  oftware program in the know universe. Actually, it is that, and so much, much, much (can't say much enough) more. It is a  computer  software program, information and retrieval system, error correction, and self replication all in one. The error correction part of the DNA was once thought to be Junk DNA, by evolutionists who were too quick to make assumptions that
were shown to be in error.",UgzbKgzuOsIDYHrkscZ4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T18:58:21.000Z,18,UPggkvB9_dc,0.989

TREY FRED,"Question: Do all biological systems have digital data, book like data, software data, and self replication data in their makeup. Answer YES. Even the covid 19 virus--designed by the Crisper program--in a Chinese Wuhan Lab has digital data--THAT IS HOW HUMANS COULD ALTER ITS DESIGN AND CREATE ANOTHER VIRUS. A virus has this data, a bacteria has 1 million lines of this data according to Carl Sagan, but both a virus and a bacteria need a host. So these will not do for first life. An amoeba has 400 Million lines of this data according to Carl Sagan--and this creature is closer to what was needed for evolution to be true because it is self replicating. So who wrote these 400 million lines of code? What is more probable, a Mind, or a random chance process. Natural selection can only start after life begins so for first life you are stuck with pure random chance. What is the best inference to the best explanation (the method Darwin used)? How do we find the answer to this question scientifically? By looking at processes in operation today that have the desired effect.  Well from our repeated experience,  Minds produce digital, and specified complex data.    Richard Dawkins, and others, admit they don't know how life began, but of course they ""BELIEVE"" they have FAITH that evolution is true. They also BELIEVE, they have FAITH, by definition--if their is no God--that the Universe Exploded into being 10 to the 18 seconds ago by nothing and from nothing, a scientific impossibility. Then they BELIEVE, have FAITH, that life (abiogenisis) came from THAT SAME ROCK that exploded 10 to the 18 seconds ago. My point is, at some point, we all have FAITH.

I on the other hand, see the hand of a designer, not just because the Bible says so, but because math dictates a designer to the universe. Nothing cannot produce everything. Non life, cannot produce life since LIFE NEEDS digital data from a mind  to survive and replicate. Especially in a Universe governed by the second law of Thermodynamics. This universe is going from order to disorder--the exact opposite of evolution.  In other words, while the universe and everything in is is headed towards heat death (is running down) the evolutionist  wants me to believe that Life came from nothing, and evolved to a form so complicated that the digital information inside human DNA now contains 10,000 volumes of data.

Atlas Ravenwood,"Sexuality is neither chosen nor changed. I agree with that, naturally, it isn't chosen or changed. It just happens naturally. But, there are some questioms left unanswered. For one, could sexuality be related in significant degree to gender identity. Of course, it obviously couldn't be dictative of it, but does that have a role to play, or even vice versa? Kinda like a game of ""what came first?"" Chicken or the Egg? Another good question would be a situation where a person is intimate enough with their own  emotions to consciously gauge their sexuality and choose to try something new, like a heterosexual being bi-sexual or homosexual becoming bi-sexual. Considering that many people with these sexualities share some psychological traits, how would these traits change? Would they be altered or just added upon? Would the person making a conscious and enlightened decision to spread out their sexuality be changing, or would they just find what they always preferred but didn't realize making them already the sexuality they were going to choose? But what if they revert back in another conscious decision? Would that mean the years they spent as gay after going straight actually have had that persom be straight despite their sexual encounters during all these years? Are people really born gay or straight when we all start in a womb with the same body parts and tools omitting special cases and the obvious? Where does philosophy stop and science start here? Vice versa? Are you seeing why it isn't appropriate to make claims that we don't have definitive proof for yet? Nobody has even asked these questions in the appropriate settings, but that doesn't mean they aren't necessary to finding answers and actually understanding what sexuality is and what purpose it serves. It's easy to put something together, but in science specifically, one flaw and it all falls apart. Don't get me started on polygamy, which we  vilify primarily to ancient and ancient religious beliefs when there is nothong saying that a state of love can't exist between three or four people, ir asexuality which is by far ome of the most inspiring sexualities I have seen, considering they are fewer in comparison.

1 magnetic Field 
 2 temperature sensitive 
3 where you ar relative to other mass it's a little different for ""birds"" but the environment is pach work of currents pressure and temperature and there cause is based off environment changes so food sources and other factors passively train behavior through bio chemical releases like dopamine or something in anticipation for a high humidity and heat of a marsh or swamp gives off chemical signals for high decomposition which means  heat which means head in to the poop smelling warm wind there's lots of  bugs and small fish.

example fish if you know where in the water they hang out you can put more fish in the tank and low light fish use bio electric sensors because low light

A bit later Toyota had better luck selling their Land Cruiser 4x4s here.  They had the original Chevrolet six, licensed from GM.  By 1965 the Corona sedan began to sell well, a Galaxie as big as a VW Bug.  I drove a 69 Corona, Vegas from new in a garage.  Let it go in '10.

Jimmy Yang,"It is a little unfortunate that this series doesnt mention the Anaconda Plan, especially because of how important it is on the APUSH exam.

The Anaconda Plan, as Im sure you know, was the Union Plan to naval blockade the South while capturing key cities on the Mississippi River such as New Orleans and Vicksburg to cut off trade to the South and prevent the Confederacy from importing materials like food or exporting cotton to Europe. 

Its important to note because 1) Its why Grant was tasked with seizing cities on the Mississippi in the first place and 2) It prevented the Confederacy from being able to send diplomatic envoys to Britain and France to appeal to their support, especially since there was a diplomatic close call when the Union naval blockade seized a ship of Confederate diplomats heading to Britain, which caused both a scandal in both Britain and the North.

Eva,"I understand the comment about how you should not view human history a straight line from primitive to civilized and that this linearity is too simplistic. However, a segment from the energy episode with substitute teacher Stan comes to mind in which he says that it is not realistic to think that humand will drastically cut back on their energy consumption to solve the current problem of its unsustainability. The reason for this, he says, is that it would be a step backwards and that would feel like regression. Both these statements seem logical, but also contradictory to me.

P.D. Evans,"If co2 were like the temperature control knob for the earth, the way the lefties want you to believe then how is it possible that when the co2 levels were 10 to 15 times higher in the past, the global average didnt go up by the same amount.? 3 degrees by 10 to 15 times.  
  The temperature of the earth has been remarkably steady for the 80% of the time that it wasn't locked in ice ages. 

It was at a global average of 22-25 Celsius For 400 of the last 500 million years.  

.  Despite wild fluctuations in co2 from 7000 ppm down to our current 415 ppm 
If they're saying now, that our 2 or 3 ppm per year addition is going to raise the planet  temperature by 3 degrees by 2100 then how was earth able to stay within a roughly 12 Celsius degree range through thousands of ppm of co2  for a 100 million years at a time   ? 
 The ice age global average  was about  10C. 
The  temperature range has remained incredibly consistent.  
It doesnt feel that way to us because we are a blip on the time scale. And our blip occurred during a  multi-million year set of   ice ages that we are hopefully seeing the end of now. 
If we dropped into another ice age now  it would be ww3 because other countries wouldnt just let us take their land. And even if we did invade There wouldn't be any way to feed all the world in the land that was left. It would be chaos and Armageddon

When components were completed being filled to label claim and the  required head space, then nitrogen was introduced to inhibit degradation. Since nitrogen is heavier than oxygen, it  displaced and removed  the oxygen, thus making a longer and safer self life. The other result is, the package, tube, bottle etc... becoming more stable  to the point of those units also being more sturdy. t\That is why you can't crush a bottle until it's opened or bag of chips pop if you crushed it.

Guest Account,When I was in highschool there was a TV remote control  in the size of a chocolate which while watching some boring TV I used to throw in the air and when it turned couple of times I found out that I catch it back always at the same manner depending of how many turns it did in the air. So I was mastering the ability to throw it as many turns in the air so I could catch it the same way it was handled at the moment it was twrown. It rotated in all axes and it was obvious due to the 9V battery inside that it was simetrical weight left-right and asimetrical front-reaer. Back then while doing this exercise I was always thinking about the sports gymnastic competitors throwing themselves in the air making countable saltos so they finally land back at their feet facing the same direction. So I guess if they watched more sports scientists would probably find out these dependencies earlier!,Ugwg5jBENPxDbX62GYJ4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-16T04:13:22.000Z,4,1VPfZ_XzisU,0

Pimpom Resolution,"Sadly this isn't even close to ""from scratch"".  Many of us are watching this from outside the Western world. Here in Thailand, you can't simply buy a used stirling cooler. Most eBay sellers don't ship them here, and even if you could the shipping and import duties would run you thousands of dollars. ""From scratch"" implies you can get parts you need locally. I saw both a nitrogen membrane and a stirling cooler, both are parts which disqualify the ""from scratch"" label.

Veritasium,"Judging from the comments and likes:dislikes, I missed the mark with this video.
I just want to make it clear that the failing was my own and not because of any brand talking points. They asked me what I wanted to talk about and I said 'how electric cars are the future.' They gave me total control over the script and video and didn't ask me to change a thing.Personally I didn't think this video was too branded because it's about electric cars in general. I drive an electric car and I like it a lot.

I see a lot of the comments concerned that I didn't talk about the negatives of electric cars. That's because this video is about why electric cars are the future, not 'why electric cars have some challenges to overcome'. Some people interpret the lack of negatives like I was only allowed to say positive things. That's not true.

Obviously in hindsight I should have talked about:
Electric cars are still expensive - sure but as I noted battery costs are coming way down and they're cheaper to run

Electric cars produce more CO2 to manufacture than gas cars - but they compensate within 1-5 years by being more efficient and producing less to run

Lithium mining isn't great for the environment - true but no mining is great for the environment (it takes a lot to make any car) and we can recycle the batteries a lot more cheaply than going back to mining the raw material. New battery designs are also reducing the amount of rare metals required.

For long road trips you do need to take pit stops around charging stations.

If you're thinking about people charging at night, how does that affect the electricity grid? I personally think it's a good thing because it evens out demand, which is usually highest during the day.

Hydrogen fuel cell cars - this is just something I personally don't see happening because there's not enough existing infrastructure. Electricity is everywhere, easily charge at your house. Hydrogen is not. When I was graduating college in 2004 hydrogen fuel cell cars were meant to be right around the corner.

Hassan Abuabed,"7:47    *NOT TRUE*
I enjoyed the vedio but allow me to disagree. Blood letting was also a useful practice at it's time. Don't take it from me see YouTube What I've Learned.
*Further explanation below.*

 he explained it really well (1million subscriptions ) at min 8 into the vedio.
https://youtu.be/1MH2ZKt35K4

*If you don't want to watch the vedio* or it's to complex. I'll explain you why blood letting is also a traditional practice just like cod drink, well similar to the lack of sunlight. Agriculture lead to accumulation of iron ( similar to how Virdasium explain in his vedio that agriculture lead to less on Cod fish in the Vikings diet).

So agriculture in the Europeans made them full of iron What I've Learned  further explains why lack of hem iron which found in meat makes vegetarianns store more regular iron found in plant based dites like agriculture which causes a disease ""that I forgotten the name of"". 

And so what's the solution you may ask.

Most women don't have that disease since they are ""blood leting"" in thier periods. Hince the solution to most men to that desirse is  donate blood.
Or *BLOOD LETTING* 

This matter made me develop my understanding of genetic and tradition, making my live a way more satisfying and fullfilling.

How would this necesserilly means something like ""magntic navigation"" whatever in human brain?

Well, I mean, the humam brain os pretty much all about eletricity, right?! - firing, wiring, etc.

And, when It comes to eletricity, magnetism comes together, isnt It?! - sort of what Faradey showed, right?!

Would It be so hard t suppose that eletricity and magnetism do have any influence in humans brain? And all without the need of any special receptor or whatever, necesserilly?!

Wouldnt It be more of a ""How does magntic Fields do interact with humans"" sort of question? If some specific  magntic Fields might have some influence in humans mood, for example. If there's, maybe, some kind of evolutionary brain clue that points t some rea in the crtex that might've been once responsable for processing this sort of data? Or something like that?!

Otherwise, It might be kind of misleading... I mean, magntic Fields interacting with the eletromagnetic stuff of the brain... Which might be sort of obvious... Maybe? ! - unless there's some sort of isolating thing in the skull... Which Doesnt sounds quite likely to be... Or maybe I'm Just wrong.

Brain Teaser,"Man. Aether can explain measured time dilation too (ie using entrpy/atomic decay to approximate absolute time). The equivalence principle (and special relativity) is falsified by the twin brother paradox. If you divide the universe to the set of the traveling brother with his ship and the rest of the universe's particles, then you have to ask which one gets the time dilation because they are all equal. The things that differentiate the two sets are their mass and size (ie distance/space). So the dilation for the bigger and more massive set is distributed and becomes less measurable. But then in any aether drag theory, mass and distance are exactly what decide the aether drag effect which change photon speed which changes the speed of any interactions involving the electromagnetic field such as atomic decay.",UgwoB8eEQ_eOq3y2mDl4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T18:08:12.000Z,18,aKwJayXTZUs,-0.85

Robert Rust,"The equation E=mc2 was already known in the 1800's in various mathematical expressions.  The theory of relativity is the theory of nonsense. ""Time"" is three dimensional, not one dimensional. I.e., time is not a thing, it is the process of comparing.  To time is to compare one motion to a reference motion, such as a running person to a swinging pendulum. To travel in time is to travel in comparing. Time travel is as simple as spitting, just walk down any street and compare all the things you see to each other. By living and existing, you are ""time"" travelling. Sensing is timing, i.e, comparing motions to get usable information. Existence is motion, not a ""thing"". 


Fission is the decay/destruction/breakdown of matter/chemicals, similar to molecular breakdown/chemical reaction. Fusion is an entirely different beast, it is the creation of denser atoms/matter through constantly-applied/sustained extreme pressure. Chemical/fission reaction releases pressure, fusion requires pressure. Fusion is only capable in stars where adequate extreme pressures are sustained constantly. The instant that the pressure reduces below a critical value is the instant that the fusion ends is the instant that the fusion radiation ends.


Nuclear bombs are impossible because the very instant of the beginning of the ""explosion"" would be the very instant of the end of the ""explosion"" since the critical pressure being applied to start the fusion is instantly reduced by the outward ""explosion"". The sun radiates because it is always under extreme pressure, the sun doesn't explode.  Fusion cannot be sustained on or in Earth, we have no way to sustain the pressure required, but fission easily can because it's the breakdown of unstable atoms, not the creation of stable, larger atoms.  


Fission is decay pressure, it can go critical if enough decaying mass is brought together, releasing a sudden flash of intense radiation. If the mass is kept below critical mass, then only much less intense radiation is released and can be used to heat water. If fission matter collects into too great of a mass, it goes critical and can overheat its surrounding water pool, turn it to steam and thereby blow the roof off of the nuclear power plant. The steam pressure blows the roof off, not the decaying radiating nuclear fuel which just radiates until it's fully decayed to stable atoms. 


Fission is similar to a piece of paper warming up. As the paper gets to a critical temperature (pressure) of 454 F, the paper will flash to C02 and water, i.e., release radiation while breaking down into smaller molecules. 


The best a fission ""bomb"" could do is release a flash of radiation. Radiation is not explosive, it just burns when too concentrated, e.g., standing too close to a fire. The flash is the chain reaction, but it only continues if the mass remains stuck together. A fission ""bomb"" can't exist because the ""exploding"" mass would immediately be blown apart, thereby dropping the critical pressure to zero. Radiation is emitted, not exploded, in a sudden flash or slowly.


To claim that such things as fission, fusion, or nuclear bombs exist is to claim that water will explode when it freezes or melts. At standard atmospheric pressure, the critical point for water is 32 F, it then ""flashes"" to ice, or if ice, it ""flashes"" to water. If you're not convinced, then you might want to sell your fridge and stay indoors all winter, just to remain safe.


Mod Civ is just being fear manipulated by the usual suspects as a means for them to endlessly divide, conquer, and thusly profit over humanity. The sheople are watching too much of the parasite's Tv and Hollywood movies instead of using their brains for thinking critically, no flashes of insight coming out of those bottoms. 


Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carpet fire-bombed, the populace hiding out in bomb shelters of course, the destruction not noted as anything unusual by the Japanese government, same as the rest of the cities in Japan and Germany that were burned to the ground by intense Allied fire bombings, millions of humans torched and burned up. The only thing going off in ""nuclear testing"" is tonnes of TNT, which is why ""nuclear"" bombs are still measured in terms of kilotons and megatons of TNT. The closest anyone has gotten to 10,000 tonnes of TNT going off and lived to tell about it is about 3 miles. It's all theatre and fakery. It ain't the billionth time that the masses have been duped, keep counting.


Only the military has the ""secrets"" of how to make a nuclear ""bomb"", and everyone should know that military intelligence and intelligence are opposites, the former is Lie and the latter is Truth. Military is all about covert behaviour and spreading fear and lies, that's the reason for its existence.

Brain Teaser,I think another important part of nuclear fission stability is that we constantly intervene during the reaction. I remember they have some kind of shield that they move up and down to control the reaction factor in the chain reaction. Too much output energy and they move the shield to cool down the reaction and too little and then they increase the multiplier by moving the shield. It will be nice if we can minimize our effort and intervention though.,UgzQxBD55_sueUPJmFF4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-15T03:49:35.000Z,3,HD3k1hgbUXQ,0.8519

Veritasium,"FAQ:
1. This is similar to the Magnus effect in that the relative motion of a spinning ball through fluid creates a force that affects its motion. It's different in that here the fluid starts the ball spinning and there is an equilibrium point around which there are restoring forces. In the Magnus effect the ball must be spinning to begin with and since the fluid is everywhere it can continually change speed and direction.
2. It's not the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect relies on entraining fluid from the surrounding area creating a region of low pressure. Here there is no water surrounding the stream to entrain (since it is a narrow stream).
3. Adhesion between the water and the ball is important - this is what directs the water flow over the ball.
4. The sum of the forces I show should not be zero but equal and opposite to the weight of the ball. Hence the forces of up and out from the initial contact with the stream and up and in from the spray add to make an upward force equal to weight (the in part of the second force is much more important than the up part)
5. It would be interesting to try this with a hydrophobic coating and see if it still works. My hypothesis is it would be much harder.
6. Apparently there are other fountains and toys that use this principle that I was unaware of. This video uses the design created by my friend Blake.",UggePRXNdVD-GHgCoAEC,none,689,2017-06-27T07:47:26.000Z,7,mNHp8iyyIjo,0.904

Kevin Kall,Gravity has been misidentified since its inception. The force that may seem to be defined as 'gravity' is really a transferring pressure from high to low like heat conducts. What keeps you on the ground is not something sucking your atoms downward. What keeps you on the ground is something from space aether pushing you down. What needs to be done is an experiment that measures the force under something pulling away from an object versesthe force above something pushing against the object.,Ugxe8eM8DzhCOnWlRr94AaABAg,none,0,2020-02-01T06:22:17.000Z,6,NVKO7UCIlgs,-0.2648

Brain Teaser,"You and the physics community might find this useful. The Bayes trap is actually not a trap. The brain simplifies the formula on purpose so calculation can be carried out quickly. This means in many cases the intuition gives you wrong final probability because of simplification. This is the reason why a theory of everything in physics cannot be used to carry out predictions to extreme precision. The unsimplified formula will be gigantic. By the time you get the calculation even with the fastest super computer, the physical world has already finished with actual result. So you end up described things that already happened. As you can see, with even a seemingly small example you gave, the full Bayesian formula is already annoyingly long to compute. This is why obsession with extreme precision when not necessary is often a waste of resources.

Isn't anyone else bothered by the fact that we are all expected to take these clowns word that they were able to accomplish this absurd level of isolation and quietude? Not to mention the fact that the experiment is so elaborate and expensive that nobody else will be able to attempt it? Well, it certainly didn't bother the Nobel Committee. Folks, this isn't Science. It's parlor tricks. Just like the tricks of the CMBR measurement  (a poorly designed experiment which violated the rules of statistical significance), and the purported photo of a Black Hole (which wasn't a true photo but a CGI generated artifact). And let's not forget Dark Matter which remains undetected after billions of dollars and decades of searching (it seems to be intentionally hiding).

Jakub Jan BorkaÅ?a,"I do not know if this topic has already been touched on but I think that another disadvantage of the magazine publication system is that reviewers do not get money for it. It takes a long time to read the article thoroughly and verify all the results contained in it. A scientist who gets an article for review has his work to do for which he gets money (from a grant for example) and will be accounted for it, he is not able to devote from several days to a week to an in-depth review. For this reason, articles with errors may go through the review system and sometimes valuable article may be rejected due to a superficial analysis of the publication by the reviewer. I think magazines should reward reviewers and require reliable reviews. Magazines charge a fee for publishing an article and then for accessing the same article. I may not have access to the article I published myself if the University doesn't have access to a given journal. Scientists do it as it is said for prestige and possibly discounts on the price of publishing their articles in a given journal. (this note regards some journals, in fact the most prestigious) This is a description from the perspective of physical sciences, maybe researchers from other fields have different thoughts.

Wayne Mackie,"As a racecar engineer I have always been fascinated by this concept and how high intensity sports are able to reduce the lag in ones perception of time. Many people have experienced time slowing down when they have been in high intensity moments and I often find that it is when people have a good understanding of the physics of what is happening to them. The brain can then somehow increase its frame rate to absorb more information about how the event occurred. For sportspeople, like racing drivers, this experience happens in real time and often. It is when they fully understand what is going on around them and are able to process the experience faster, it allows them to achieve almost super human feats.

NephilimFree,"Evolution became a laughable myth in the 20th century, during which it was disproved by millions of discoveries. One such discovery is that polymerase is a product of it's own translation, which proves Special Creation. Another is the discovery that the cell's structural design is not generated by genetic information, but is instead passed on by reproduction form the reproductive cells of the parents (Cortical Inheritance) which traces back to the original created organism. Evolutionism is a philosophy which is contradicted by science. Over 100 yrs ago, Evolution Theory was plausible for naturalists because of their rejection of God. Biological science was rudimentary and archaic, and provided no information about the operations of the cell. Modern biology has very greatly changed what is known of genetics and biology. It has been discovered that life is based upon information which is digitally encoded and stored in a more compressed form than man's best computer compression schemes.

Evolutionism arose from a rejection of Christian values in the 18th century, leading to a rise in secular humanism which required a materialistic explanation for man's existance free of God. This rise in humanism was fueled by a lack of adequate effort of Christians to defend the truth against new false ideas that were nothing more than replacements for one truth or another, as well as the outsourcing academic and scientific control to those who are non-believers. Rejection of truths for imaginary ideas has caused many to fall into believing that philosophical ideas from the secular world are scientific because secular men of science said it was so. Today the tables are turning, and there is increasing support in both the scientific community and the general public for Special Creation and Intelligent Design among scientists of all fields. The threat is so great to secular control over academia that secular scientists are resorting more than ever to harsh treatment of evolution doubters or disbelievers of evolutionism. The priests of evolutionism are now typically afraid to debate the subject of evolution and creation on college campuses because of the history of them being so clearly refuted in such debates, and so now they severely fear being refuted in front of their own students and the media.

DNA is a material medium encoded with information which is organized to conform to linguistics, possesses algorithmic information processing operations, and the human language properties of phonetics, semantics, punctuation, syntax, grammar, and aprobatics. The information input and output processing of DNA includes the analytical operations of proofreading, information comparison, cut, insert, copy-and-past, backup, and restore, all of which operate by algorithmic operations. There is no potential for the material actions of chemistry to produce information, algorithms, and linguistics. They are non-physical fundamental entities that can only be produced by intelligence. This fact is proof that all life was designed by a mind of supreme intelligence. Because of this and many other biological discoveries, it has been overwhelmingly demonstrated that evolution is impossible and creation is a scientific fact.

DNA is a 4-dimentional (3 dimentions  time) operating system which is far more complex than man's computer software technology, posessing many thousands of information hierarchies and pathways in the cell. When the DNA molecule is supercoiled as chromatin, some of it's information is available to the cell which is not available when the molecule is uncoiled, and when it is not supercoiled, some of it's information is available to the cell which is not available when it is supercoiled. DNA is a dual-directional information package, providing different information depending upon which strand and direction the transcription machinery of the cell is traveling. Man does not know how to to write computer software that can be read both forward and backwards to provide separate information processes and functionality. It is beyond our ability. DNA's individual information sequences are overlapping and nested sharing nucleotides between sequences, and information in different locations of the molecule are interdependent with each other, even when separated by hundreds or thousands of base pairs in distance from each other - a feature which exemplifies why chemical processes cannot design DNA.

DNA possesses codes built upon codes which regulate the use of each other, even when they are distant from each other in the molecule. Genetic algorithms and information possess forward-thinking properties, which nature is incapable of producing because molecules are not sentient. During an organism's development, the genetic information instructs the cell on how to turn on and off, like chemical switches, many sequences of information of the DNA in a supremely complex and yet to be understood orchestral arrangement of various groupings and orders so as to build the structures of the organism over time. These patterns of genes being switched on and off is so complex that man will likely never be able to decipher it.

If you want to believe in evolution because you refuse to acknowledge the existence of our creator, nobody can stop you. But doing so is to be a denialists of the discoveries of modern science because the truth is uncomfortable, and to continue to believe things which the outdated concept of Charles Darwin over 150 yrs ago could not have predicted. Believing in evolution today is as antiquated as it was to believe that flies arose from meat, or that frogs arose from mud a century prior to Darwin. 

Eugenie Scott, the popular militant defender of evolutionism has stated, ""If your local campus Christian fellowship asks you to ""defend evolution,"" please decline. Public debates rarely change many minds; creationists stage them mainly in the hope of drawing large sympathetic audiences. Have you ever watched the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Federals? The Federals get off some good shots, but who remembers them? The purpose of the game is to see the Globetrotters beat the other team. And you probably will get beaten.""

Atheists in fact hate the Scientific Method and refuse to employ it. Example: 100 years of random genetic mutation experimentation, over one million studies, has provided consistent results demonstrating that random mutations are destructive and negative to organisms, both biochemically and anatomically, and do not add anything useful to the physiology of any organism, not even incrementally. Conclusion? Mutation cannot be a mechanism for accruing change that results in macroevolution. But what does the atheist conclude despite such a massive body of evidence? They continue believing that random mutation IS a mechanism for accruing change that results in mind-bending complexity, microscopic interdependent machinery, and macroevolution, not because of science, but because their worldview requires it to be, since if evolution were true, random mutation would have to be the base mechanism for evolution because genetic information defines organisms. In this way, they refuse to come to the correct conclusion because of their paradigm, tossing out the Scientific Method and the conclusion it would require them to accept.

Examples of how atheists refuse to comply with the Scientific Method are nearly countless, and found in all fields of science. I would say that based upon this fact, atheists are incapable of being objective, responsible scientists in any field which relates to the universe, organic life, or history. Atheists should be kept away from academia of any field like small children should be kept away from matches.

Anthony Flew, once the word's foremost atheist academic who's former arguments are some of the posters upheld by atheists to this day, converted to a theist and creationist because of the biological evidence.

Javier costa henere,"Also Bernoulli's principle does apply too. The ball spinning does affect the speed of the layer of air in touch with it, making it that the air gets speeded up (or less slowed down) than in the other side. Bernoulli's principe explains that the energy of air flow depends on speed, preassure (related with temperature aswell) and potential energy in form of graviational potential energy. In the case of the ball the air flow doesn't change altitude nor mass so that gravitational energy remains constant. But as in one side the air moves faster than the other, the faster side has less preassure than the slower side, which creates a force from the high preassure side to the low preassure side. That is what creates the lift force in airfoils that allows planes to fly.",Ugw6Y1X5kWp_T82o4lV4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-14T13:03:49.000Z,13,2OSrvzNW9FE,0.7168

Slider68,"Hmmm. About this theory that if ice didn't float either the earth would be much warmer or much cooler...


What about the possibility that everywhere we currently have ice on the surface due to near continuous periods of below freezing temperatures that the ice would freeze solid, producing the same white surface we see today and everywhere we currently don't have ice we still would not have ice, producing the same dark surface we see today. Ultimately the earth might be exactly the same temperature it is currently - just you wouldn't find fish and other creatures living in the arctic and antarctic (or perhaps they would learn how to freeze solid and go into a state of near permanent stasis and wait, and wait, and wait until the ice eventually melted following some life altering natural or unnatural phenomenon).",Ugw8SM9ZNbBsVUcz17d4AaABAg,none,0,2020-02-03T20:36:49.000Z,20,5RLQ9WMP2Es,0.7096

Gerald Eldreth,"Maybe i'm thinking too much into this, but what about barometric pressures and buoyant force?  When the balance is released, the pressure exerted on the water shifts to find its lowest state of energy.  Since the ping pong ball is suspended in the water, the water in it's vessel cannot move to accommodate any imbalance of pressure.  The Acrylic ball however is not in a fixed position in its vessel, so if there is an imbalance in the pressure the water can shift to accommodate.  Presumably since the ping pong ball has some small amount of mass, and the amount of water in the vessels is equal; the balance would be only slightly weighted towards the ping pong ball side in the absence of the acrylic ball.  When the Acrylic ball is introduced into the the other vessel displacing water it is under a buoyant force with the water and an imbalance of pressure is exerted on the water.  The barometric pressure on the water must be higher than the weight of the water which is being displaced by the Acrylic ball.  At sea level the barometric pressure is almost 15 lbs psi.  Since the amount of water being displaced is about 4 cubic inches it probably only weighs about 0.15 lbs, and the barometric pressure on the water is much greater than that.  So the scale tips towards the Acrylic ball because the barometric pressure put on the water applies a greater buoyant force on the acrylic ball.

Ethan Krauss,"I would very much like to see the math that shows it would take 6 years to charge a cell phone with a Kelvin Thunderstorm.  I would guess it could do it in more like a few months or less. It might be difficult with current technology to reduce the voltage efficiently enough to actually use the energy though.  Perhaps it wasn't meant to be a literal power estimate. 
On another note, I also wonder what is the minimum current a spark has to have, in order to be visible.  There are plenty of references on the internet that mention about sparks jumping about 30kV per cm, but nothing that mentions minimum current for visible sparks.

Nigel McPhearson,"Oh Derek..... smh. In your quest to FEEL morally righteous and objectively correct for being a climate alarmist type of ""scientist"". You made several false claims in this presentation. The graphs you called ""several sets of data"" are not data... they are models... based on inconclusive, incomplete, or fraudulent ""data"" to make the models support alarmist agendas. I guarantee you if the IPCC was told to debunk alarmist BS, instead of their mandate to support it, they would be saying that CO2 has been much higher before with much colder temps. That green plants absorb CO2 and we've been in a CO2 drought. They would account for the urban heat island effect and the corrupt ""temp data sets"" that show this effect more than a global rise. They would disclose the fact that as temps didn't rise like alarmists hoped, they started counting only the urban heat island data points and supplementing their models with ""satellite data"" that NASA got caught falsifying. They would also point out that rising CO2 appears to be greening the earth and increasing agricultural yield while the ocean hasn't risen as much as predicted. And that trend you claim, for the last 150yrs of warming, is really us coming out of ""the little ice age"". You arrogantly ridiculed the fact that arctic sea ice had a ""little uptick"" at the end... and then extended your graph back only far enough to show a downward trend you want to push. But keep extending that data set back in time and you see the alarmist warming being negligible in the TRUE context of earth's history. The data that asteroidal impacts caused huge changes is far more compelling than your self validating ""I'm smarter and better than everyone because I want us to stop emitting CO2!!!

You are a hammer, begging for a nail... and it's disappointing. You SEEM so objectively studious on other issues. But on this, you purposefully ignored the thousands of extremely credible scientists who aren't getting free gub'ment tax money to keep ""justifying"" the alarmist narrative that compels more gub'ment money to come flowing their way, and are instead asserting very well supported claims and data sets that refute the alarmist money grab.

holger jÃ¸rgensen,"So, Now, Listen carefully,
In the Eternal Life, there is the Life-side, and the Stuff-side.
Stuff-Side is the physical reality, a Motion-Ocean, pure Motion.
So, the Stuff-Side are the effect of the 'Eternal Motion-Principle'.
Space, is Not empty, but very fine tiny 'Stuff', Space and Physics, are degree's of the very same.
You know what, Eternal and Un-changeable is the very same, are there anything about Us that is Un-changeable, - You know that your thought is a constant stream, motion,
but the 'I' behind the thoughts, is Not motion, Not of physical nature.
So, the 'I' is the only 'real steady point' in existence, behind the Motion-Ocean.
The 'I' is identical with Eternity, - the Living behind the Stuff-side, - and the 'Empty Space'.
Life has allways been, there is no beginning, no end. Life is an inner affair, We allways get born from within, al experience is realized from within, and it is this 'within', Center-Reality, that is the so'called Empty Space, which is Not really 'Space'. (space-less space)
So, the Stuff-Side is a enorm illusion, a real illusion, an eternal miracle, and seen from a eternal cosmic perspective, it obtain No Space at all, 'it is just a inner affair illusion'.

Will Gordge,"The modern sailboat is one of the purest most beautiful applications of mechanics. The video failed to describe this very well. As the wind provides a pressure gradient between both sides of the sail, the force exerted generated by the lift is somewhat parallel to the of the boats boom. Why does this not cause the boat to drift off in that direction? The center board that protrudes the bottom of the hull causes an opposite effect to take place. The force with the wind opposes the force in the water, which is stationary. The two forces can be visualized as vectors on a vector diagram. These two forces create a resultant vector, in the direction in which the boat moves, which is a single component representing the effect of all other present vectors. For those of you who know sailing, you might know now why a broad reach (135 from oncoming wind) is the fastest point of sail, not because of the wind behind generally behind the sail, but because the vectors point nearer to the direction of motion (increasing the value of the resultant) than at any other point of sail.",UgzIfsZywuhlSJnSyct4AaABAg,none,1,2020-04-06T21:20:43.000Z,21,M4CQ4T_K8Hw,0.642

RF1204,"CFD can reason the big difference in lift as the Angle of Attack is zero or a positive value:
Ansys saf1 lesson 2, https://youtu.be/Xi7ERZD_m9g have the CFD to airfoil WITH Angle-Of-Attack. At time 14:40 we see velocities: 112m/s air incidence. At first 1/3 down face wing velocity half (56m/s)(big deceleration against wing: air mass momentum, newton), next same streamline increase to again 112 during Midle 1/3 lenght down and in the last 1/3 accelerate to 170m/s following always the down shape. Above ,the air doubles from 112 to 224 during de first 1/3, but leaving the shape staying almost vacuum there. 
In the video of Mechatech  https://youtu.be/l2W-J34YwkQ  is airfoil and Angle-Of-Attack Zero. Here at time 22:30 a 45m/s air incidence half to 25m/s in the edge between top and down and above increase to 85 during 2/3 and down to 75 also during 2/3 following almost parallel to the shapes, not impacting and not creating vacuum buble, no useful lift force. The shape is a small reason to lift. I understand is to optimize coanda effect.
The main reason to lift is the Angle of Attack, until the value where stall the wing suddenly. 
 About AOA vs Lift graphic one good at    aviationchief.com/angle-of-attack.html  . After stall angle as in this page said ""lift is destroyed"", as we see many airline plane crashes by stall in program ""Mayday air disasters"", one of them Air France 447 Rio de Janeiro to Paris.

A gyroscope is a highly stabilized mass in motion. They are used in compasses,  navigational systems, platform stabilizers. To function they need to be mounted, often gimbaled. If they are not mounted correctly stability will be lost & will respond as above. The response is predictable if you understand the principles of gyroscopic inertia, orbital angular velocity & spin angular velocity.

Awesome gamers,"what happens is during an solar flare enormous amount of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun and when the entre the earths magnetic field they move in helical path along the field line which is basically due to the components of the velocity of proton and electron where the V parallel component (parallel to magnetic field) goes along x axis and the v perpendicular component (perpendicular to magnetic field) experience Lorentz force and do circular motion along y axis and both components combined , it gives us the resulting trajectory as helical motion . when the electron during the helical motion hits the atmosphere atoms the produce respective light color like if electron hits the oxygen atom it emits green light and when hits nitrogen atom it emits pink color .

But the question is why only on northen side or near the poles . The answer for that is like in bar magnet the magnetic field is strong at the ends (poles) same works there earth is like a bar magnet the north and south pole of the earth have high magnitude of magnetic field and due to this fact the speed of the helical motion will be faster than any other parts of the earth . And clearly more speed more the excitation more will be the intensity of visible and light and we can see it clearly .

Keeper Holderson,"Honestly, I don't know how to depict an electron, let alone an atom. The force of electrostatic repulsion within an electron must be tremendously intense, the gravity is as always negligible. And there's no explanation for how the individual electrons stay whole. Yet there's tons of papers on the geometries of electrons, hell, I've even stumbled across a paper about asymmetric electrons. We also give electrons a property of spin. All that to say, we think and never doubt the assumption that electrons have volume. Yet our logic is flawed since we don't apply the coulombs law to the volume of an individual electrons, while readily applying it to two separate volumes of the same stuff. But how do they stay together if the electrostatic force within them is so tremendous? The concept of ""electron"" is altogether too fishy smelling for me to treat it seriously.",UgzcLkV24w0HXo_VChh4AaABAg,none,0,2019-08-25T12:14:17.000Z,12,357_DHp3Nys,0.1158

So how would light travel from a flashlight in a train compared to out of a train? If the answer is that they are going at the same speed and the ones in the train are just bunched closer because they don't move relative to the flashlight so the movement of the train just makes the next light particle made be starting from closer, wouldn't light seem to go at different speeds from where and what angle they are measured, meaning we don't really know what the speed of light is?",UgzYRNM9O4CeVur41fR4AaABAg,none,1,2020-03-31T18:35:52.000Z,18,vVKFBaaL4uM,0

ImAHugeTroll,"A lot of people are disagreeing with this video, and I initially did too. It seemed like it could be A for low values of spring constant, but I made a simulation of this problem and changed up values of K, and found that the limit as K approaches zero results in the total net acceleration approaching g (from above). This means that the tension force at point D must be more than double the gravitational force meaning that point D does infact have a greater magnitude of acceleration for all values of K greater than zero. This makes sense mathematically because as K approaches zero, the extension of the cord quickly approaches infinity. You can also picture the bungee jumper as an example of harmonic motion with an initial velocity greater than zero. 
The one reason why this wouldn't be true is due to air resistance. In a scenario where you consider air resistance, if the spring constant is too low, than point A becomes the point of greatest acceleration. Adding air resistance to the model, if you plot spring constant on the x axis and drag coefficient on the y axis, you get a line below which point D is the highest acceleration, and above which point A is the highest acceleration. Pretty cool, and I can understand why Derek ignored air resistance, because don't we all at first",UgzyLq6IlX2QbiaeH-J4AaABAg,none,0,2019-04-26T18:44:22.000Z,18,vKsof8ax_Ns,0.9575

James Mcfarlane,"I like this problem. I'm a physics instructor but had to think about this for a bit before I answered. I got this correct but at first went back and forth between option A and D. I had to write a net force equation to solve it. For option A: Fnet = ma = mg so the acceleration is 9.81 m/s/s downward. For option D, Fnet = ma = T - mg. However T is the tension in the rope which is equal to kx. So how do we find k? We use conservation of energy. We start with gravitational potential energy mgH and end with elastic potential energy 1/2kx^2. Set these two equal to each other at the lowest point. mgH = 1/2kx^2. Solve for k and we get k=(2mgH)/(x^2). Now let's substitute kx into our Fnet equation. Fnet = ma = kx - mg OR another way to write this is Fnet = ma = 2mgHx/(x^2) - mg. Simplify to get Fnet = ma = 2mgH/x - mg. Since H is larger than x because the total height is larger than the distance the rope stretches we get Fnet = ma = 2mg*(some number larger than 1) - mg which always results in a net acceleration value greater than 9.81 m/s/s. So it doesn't depend on k or m because in order for the bungee jumper to not hit the ground, H must be larger than x.",Ugy1nx6QlhKVz4RQf7l4AaABAg,none,0,2017-11-19T00:31:15.000Z,0,exG4aGlCmEE,0.8882

Corneliu Rusu,"The answer depends not only on the elasticity of the rope, but also on the height from which he jumps and his mass. Let me explain:
Initially, potential energy is mgH, and there is no kinetic energy. At the bottom, potential energy is 1/2 kx^2 (we can neglect the height at the bottom).
So, mgH = 1/2 kx^2. From here we get x = sqrt (2mgH / k).
The elastic force at the bottom is: kx, which is equal to sqrt (2kmgH).
This needs to be greater than 2mg, for the acceleration to be higher at the bottom than at the top.
Let's see:
sqrt (2kmgH) >? 2mg
If we square this. we get:
2kmgH >? 4m^2g^2
kH/2m > g
So, this is the condition for the acceleration to be greatest at the bottom. It shows clearly that it depends on k, H and m, which can all vary independently. For example, which is very intuitive, if the height is not big enough, then the acceleration at the bottom can be very weak.",UgiJhabw7QoD-3gCoAEC,none,1,2014-08-31T10:21:15.000Z,10,exG4aGlCmEE,0.7992
Sean Stotyn,"Curses! I'm a physicist and I got this wrong... My initial intuition was that the correct answer relies on the elastic properties of the bungee but this is not the case. You can use conservation of energy to get the spring constant k of the bungee: mgH = 1/2 kh^2, where H is the height of the platform and h is the amount the bungee is stretched from when it first becomes taught to its lowest point. Then you balance the forces at the bottom, kh - mg = ma, and sub in the previous value for k. Cancelling common factors you find a = g(2H/h - 1). Since h<H, it must always be that a>g, so acceleration at the bottom is always greatest. ",Ugir7DBCQ0jxK3gCoAEC,none,8,2014-07-12T02:59:05.000Z,2,exG4aGlCmEE,0.7122

If you dont want to go to the trouble, shut up & listen hard.
The ultimate power source in Australia (excluding Victoria because it has sh1t weather), is to go with mass adoption at the residential level of solar panels & the option of storage.
Before you science try-hard professionals dump on me, there are real world advantages to it, none of which youve made mention of.
The power source (PV & storage) is at the load point, so theres less stress on the entire established multi-layer transmission/distribution system that finally makes it to your home.
To expand on that, all transformers including power plants, their respective transmission transformers, the feeder transformers at local substations, right down to the local distribution transformers that drop the HV feeder lines to a suitable residential voltage level benefit.

It's compounded by the fact that, unless you did physics or something in school, you're probably never gonna call heat ""radiation"". You're probably just gonna say ""hot"" or ""cold"".
I'm sure I do similar things for fields I'm less interested in. It's only natural for the general public's understanding to be less refined.

Louis Drapeau,"Hello, I would really like to hear, your answer on my question.  If I take a 1Kg say of cement, or better a rock that I put on my scale here (45.68N 73.88W 175' ASL) and read exactly 1Kg.  Assuming we get both items to the moon, I need to know only the difference if one exists, between the indication of the scale on the moon at the time this message is being written (approx 15:00 GMT 2020-04-07) on spot A and on spot B.  Spot A being the closet spot on the moon from my location and spot B being the farthest spot on the moon from my location?




Now, I'm not looking for all the formulas, you will lose me.   I would think that my rock would appear a bit litter on the surface of the moon closest to the earth, but I need to know if the difference  would be like 0.0001g or more like 0.1g or a number way out of this range?

Let's say you froze time. For that moment, the gravities of the two celestial bodies are lik3 a stretched red rubber string of fate connecting the closest point on their surfaces to each other. Yet as both are spinning, the very next frozen moment, there are two new points pulling on each other. This does not negate the first two however, now causing a direct and angular pull between the earth and the moon. 

Similar to how your body combines the forward and angular momentums of your turning car to push you in the midway, gravity's angular and direct pulls combine to pull the moon into an orbit.",Ugz_BhFiD-q3k6Q-uWN4AaABAg,none,0,2019-12-17T11:29:35.000Z,11,zN6kCa6xi9k,0

kok fah chong,"Free electrons (current electric) are saturated with more photons than the one of stationary electrons (electrons that confined within an atom). Higher saturation of photons on free electrons enable them to skip from atom to atom due to their higher momentum. This is suggesting that photons are particles where arresting dynamic photons will increase their momentum. Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can't interchange one another according to Einstein's famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. Photons are negatively charged particles. With higher saturation of photons onto free electrons will make them perceived to be more negatively charged. Since higher potential free electrons are saturated with more stationary photons therefore higher potential free electrons from cathode will encounter stronger suction for them by the anode. In conclusion, photons have mass and they are negatively charged particles. Therefore charge per mass ratio of electrons is not a constant since free electrons of different potential differences will have different saturation of stationary photons. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

Muzaffard36,"Bjorn probably lost more than Ragnar in this show.
1.He lost his sister.
2.He was separated from his father.
3.His first wife, Thorunn was deformed in a battle.
4.Betrayed by his uncle Rollo.
5.Thorunn left him, their daughter died in a horrible way alone.
6. Nearly died more than once,  ambushed by berserker in cold weather, pounced by bear, shot near the heart in Paris raid and much more.
7. Had to cope with his father in his depressed period.
8. He left Torvi who was the most faithful and loyal for a third new lover, he had lots of doubts but Torvi didn't mind.
9. He lost his new lover.
10. His and Torvi's son died due to his mistakes of letting Ivar's goons live.
11. He showed mercy to Hvitserk despite not admitting it like Ragnar did with Rollo but a mistake as Hvitserk then allied himself with Ivar (whom before, he accidentally killed Lagertha for and hated him so much that he had nightmares about it).
12. He married Gunnhild as he loves her and wasn't loyal to her as he weds another.
14. Gunnhild and Bjorn lost their only child at birth.
15. King Harald rapes his 2nd wife.
16. Everyone around Bjorn has lost something dear to them.
17. Made the bad decisions as a King, even though most of them were merciful.
18. Wanted to keep his father's legacy, yet was stabbed by his brother Ivar, whether it was Ivar or not, i feel like the emotions expressed in that scene was meant for both of them as a symbol.
19. He lost his father and mother and i know it must pain him to not be there to protect them.
There are probably much more.
 
When he was stabbed, i felt so bad for him. He just didn't deserve it. I feel like he's always troubled by the thoughts of not fulfilling his father's legacy, he should just become himself and not his father.",UgxG7c3XWvlSbvjD-1Z4AaABAg,none,4,2020-02-14T15:19:01.000Z,15,G6YnBijnlc8,-0.9963

When you hammer or forge it it compresses it on a molecular level making the steel strong hence why forged is stronger than cast. So the guy cut it out for what he needed ""Forged"" it to shape and heat treated it. Thats the fastest and best way to do it and that inturn is why he won. Doesnt take a rocket scientist to see that progression in ideas and using science and logic to make something faster and better all in the same is better all around.

On several occasions we were given orders to engage if certain incidents occurred.  Well, there intentions to destroy targets directly violated ROEs.  A10s were flown in as were F16E which were unsuccessful to bring several objects that were under observation.  

Our unit was given a go to use our Javelins an the same results occurred.  We had later received intel that 2 clicks from our position there was a creature, that appeared to be approximately have the size of the mountains to aft of our hide.  We watched as CAS were called in an conducted by SF teams calling in air strikes an engaged.  It was a incident  none of us were prepared to believe yet acknowledge what we observed.  At our mission briefs review by team daddy, we were told to rewrite our account of interactions an replaced by Taliban engagements.

The test is meant to be done wrong, don't ever swing your weapon into a giant block of ice. I wouldn't say his injury is really anyone's fault, the blade deflected after chopping the ice like it was supposed to. Anyone holding on to something that ricocheted that fast would have a hurt wrist. The judges giving a vote of no confidence seemed unfair to me and I wish I could have seen the historically accurate blade win.

IP WARDEN,At what I say the same I mean that I mean if you can help other people do the same thing as you know going to conversations and come up with better deals and stuff like that or bargain with people or whatever the case is everybody just help each other because not only do we have this universe but we have many different universes just the same we have to set an example because before any other universes came to pass this one was created as well we are like the beginning of existence so we have to kind of like showing example we had a lot of problems and people from other universes look at us like we're idiots because there was stepping stones and making a new universe and a lot of things came to a lot of problems so if you want make an example for others to say hey we are not the same and going through the same trials and tribulations when there it is not necessary she'll revert back into your old body and if you did not have the same body others can actually help you transfer back into an elf so everyone get together and help each other out because this is our existence you know we all share the same existence of the universe there is no different types of existence here besides like a i and stuff like that which they have their own existence but if you are actually a living big and have a soul then you can revert back to yourself by there is actually efforts going on to helping people do that if you have good Tendencies and if you are a good person there should be not one person to deny others for help,UgyHDMm_duJzSoq6OeB4AaABAg,none,0,2020-04-11T23:18:13.000Z,23,VGzl7XTtDPw,0.9895
